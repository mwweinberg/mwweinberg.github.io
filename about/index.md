Hi.  I do 3D printing and legal things at [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/).  I used to try and make policy, people, and technology work together better at [Public Knowledge](https://www.publicknowledge.org/).

I'm also the President of the Board of the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://www.oshwa.org/).

You can email me at <hello@michaelweinberg.org> and find me on twitter [@MWeinberg2D](https://twitter.com/mweinberg2D).  I also have a collection of poorly written things on github as [MWWeinberg](https://github.com/mwweinberg).  A strangely large number of them are python scrapers for Chinese government data.

If you are curious, you too can have email address on your own domain thanks to [this fantastic and detailed guide](https://konklone.com/post/take-control-of-your-email-address) from [Eric Mill](https://konklone.com/).

This site is running on Jekyll and hosted on Github. It used to be on tumblr.  Maybe someday it will again.
