You should go to the website [legalmadness.party](http://legalmadness.party/) right now to check this out.

Here's the deal. [Sarah Feingold](https://www.sarahfeingold.com/) (former Etsy and Vroom GC, current Engelberg Center Fellow) and I were talking about all of the stories that in-house tech lawyers have about the things they have dealt with over the years.

"We should have an open mic night where everyone gets up and shares their stories" we exclaimed together.

"But wait, confidentiality rules would prevent any lawyers from actually telling stories at an open mic night" we also exclaimed together.

"What shall be done?" we wondered aloud, again, together.

What shall be done, indeed.

We collected the stories anonymously. We compiled them into a script. We hired actors to play the role of "tech lawyer at an open mic night" to tell them. We rented out a cool club in the Village. All that is missing is you.

Join the NYC legal tech community for the greatest simulated open mic night is has ever seen. Laugh. Cry. Commiserate. Share a story (anonymously) for next year....
