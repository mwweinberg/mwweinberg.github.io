The world is full of [great open source music players](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/audio-players-linux), but why stop at using open source just to play music? You can also use open source hardware to make music. All of the instruments described in this article are [certified by the Open Source Hardware Association](https://certification.oshwa.org/) (OSHWA). That means you are free to build upon them, remix them, or do anything else with them.

## Open source instruments

Instruments are always a good place to start when you want to make music. If your instrument choices lean towards the more traditional, the [F-F-Fiddle](https://certification.oshwa.org/us000010.html) may be the one for you.

The F-F-Fiddle is a full-sized electric violin that you can make with a standard desktop 3D printer ([fused filament fabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication)—get it?). If you need to see it to believe it, here is a video of the F-F-Fiddle in action:

Mastered the fiddle and interested in something a bit more exotic? How about the [Open Theremin](https://certification.oshwa.org/ch000001.html)?

Like all theremins, Open Theremin lets you play music without touching the instrument. It is, of course, especially good at making [creepy space sounds](https://youtu.be/p05ZSHRYXVA?t=771) for your next sci-fi video or space-themed party.

The [Waft](https://certification.oshwa.org/uk000005.html) operates similarly by allowing you to control sounds remotely. It uses [Lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) to measure the distance of your hand from the sensor. Check it out:

Is the Waft a theremin? I’m not sure - theremin pedants should weigh in below.

If theremins are too well known for you, [SIGNUM](https://certification.oshwa.org/es000003.html) may be just what you are looking for. In the words of its developers SIGNUM “uncovers the encrypted codes of information and the language of man/machine communication” by turning invisible wireless communications into audible signals.

Here it is in action:

## Inputs

Regardless of what instrument you use, you will need to plug it into something. If you want that something to be a Raspberry Pi, try the [AudioSense-Pi](https://certification.oshwa.org/in000007.html), which allows you to connect multiple inputs and outputs to your Pi at once.

## Synths

What about synthesizers? SparkFun's [SparkPunk Sound Kit](https://certification.oshwa.org/us000016.html) is a simple synth that gives you lots of room to play.

## Headphones

Making all this music is great, but you also need to think about how you will listen to it. Fortunately, [EQ-1 headphones](https://certification.oshwa.org/us000038.html) are open source and 3D-printable.
