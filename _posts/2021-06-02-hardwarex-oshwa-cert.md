Today we are excited to announce that the open hardware journal [HardwareX](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex) is integrating OSHWA certifications into their paper submission process.  

HardwareX is an open access journal that focuses on free and open source designing, building, and customizing of scientific hardware.  It has long used the [Open Source Hardware Definition](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/) as a requirement for submissions.  Now HardwareX is also integrating the [OSHWA hardware certification program](https://certification.oshwa.org/) into the paper submission process.

First, HardwareX has updated its [guide for authors](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/hardwarex/2468-0672/guide-for-authors#txt4401) to encourage (although not require) authors to certify their hardware for open source compliance before, during, or after submitting to HardwareX.  This is a win for authors and for HardwareX.  Authors can use the certification process to make sure that their hardware meets the Open Source Hardware Definition.  Certification is often an iterative process where OSHWA helps creators meet all of the Definition’s requirements.  HardwareX can rely on the OSHWA certification to confirm that hardware complies with the Definition, freeing up resources to review the papers themselves.

Second, OSHWA and HardwareX are standardizing ways to connect HardwareX articles to the [Certification Directory](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html).  HardwareX will include OSHWA certification UIDs in their specification tables for articles that include certified hardware.  Creators can update their certification directory listing with the “#HX” tag in the project description, and add a link to the HardwareX manuscript.

As the open hardware community grows, so too do our institutions.  We look forward to finding new ways to collaborate with all of the parts of the community in the future.  If you would like to connect with the certification program, please reach out at info@oshwa.org, check out our [certification program API](https://certificationapi.oshwa.org/documentation), or just [certify your own hardware directly](https://application.oshwa.org/apply)!
