*This post [originally appeared](https://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/31985-deadline-extended-smk-jewelry-contest.html) on the Shapeways blog.*

We are currently in the fourth week of a [contest collaboration](https://web.archive.org/web/20180828075305/https://www.shapeways.com/contests/smk-open-jewelry) with the [National Gallery of Denmark](http://www.smk.dk/) (SMK) where we [asked our fantastic jewelry design community](https://michaelweinberg.org/blog/2017/05/25/shapeways-smk-contest-kickoff/) to create new pieces inspired by six works from the SMK’s collection.  So far we’ve been blown away by [all you have done](https://web.archive.org/web/20180828075305/https://www.shapeways.com/contests/smk-open-jewelry). We have also been encouraged by all of the positive feedback about the contest from the both the [open museum world](https://openglam.org/) and our [jewelry community](https://www.shapeways.com/marketplace/jewelry?li=marketplace).

Among all of the positive feedback, there has been one request that we have received again and again: a bit more time. News of this contest has percolated through a number of new communities, and inspiration can come at its own pace. What we are hearing is that a little more time would allow many of you to create even more entries.

In response to those requests, **we’re extending the contest by one additional week**. Instead of ending on June 16, the contest will now end on **June 23**.

But that’s it! Barring anything truly unexpected, June 23 is going to be the final deadline. That means that if you want a chance to have your work displayed in the [National Gallery of Denmark](http://www.smk.dk/), you need to get cracking. You can see the inspiring works, check out the competition, and read the rules [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180828075305/https://www.shapeways.com/contests/smk-open-jewelry).
