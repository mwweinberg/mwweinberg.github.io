In the interest of [celebrating the weirdness of open data](https://twitter.com/tjl/status/1535290997206294528), I want to share a quick project that exists because of open data: Abraham Lincoln's left hand as the shifter knob of a 1995 Mazda truck.

The whole thing was pretty strightforward. In fact, the hardest part was probably finding the right shifter knob adapter for the truck.  All that was required was:

1. Download the Lincoln hand scans from the [Smithsonian open access site](https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/abraham-lincoln:d8c642d6-4ebc-11ea-b77f-2e728ce88125).

2. Use tinkercad to put a hole in the back of the hand.

3. 3D print the hand and use epoxy to attach the adapter.

4. Install it.
