derivative thereof, as inherently copyrightable (unlike photographs,
literature, etc.).” </b><br/></p><p>This is absolutely true.  As I wrote <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/post/139607754335/abusing-models-on-thingiverse-or-the-plight-of" target="_blank">yesterday</a>, in many if not most cases involved in this dispute, it is also largely irrelevant.  The copyrightability of CAD files is highly important if the object represented in the file is not protected by copyright or if the file was not created by the person who created the object represented in that file (i.e. if it was scanned or modeled based on an existing object).  Sculptural works - that is, physical non-functional items - are protected by copyright law.  See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102" target="_blank">17 U.S.C. (a)(5)</a>. Many of the objects in dispute will qualify as sculptural works.  They do not lose their protection simply because they are represented in a CAD file.  If that was the case the act of scanning any sculpture would automatically put it into the pubic domain.</p><p><b>2. “The essence of a CAD file is that it is a set of instructions for
producing a physical item. There is a rich history of United States IP
law, that goes back to before the United States was even a country,
regarding physical items. This history says that physical items are not
protect-able by their owners/inventors unless they have a patent, are
sourced from a pre-existing copyright, or are a &ldquo;work of
art&rdquo;/copyrightable. 90%+ of all products on sites like Thingiverse.com
clearly do not fall into one of these three buckets- which means anyone
and everyone can produce said products for any legal purpose.“</b></p><p>This mixes a few things, none of which support the position that everything on thingiverse is in the public domain.  As for the “set of instructions” argument, it goes back to the copyrightability of CAD files again.  I’m actually in the middle of a longer paper on this topic, but for now let’s just say that even if a CAD file is just a non-copyrightable set of instructions (something I believe to be largely true), everything in my response to 1 above still holds.  That is, many of the non-functional objects represented in the files are still protected by copyright.</p><p>As for the physical items, I believe that this conflates “physical items” with “functional items.”  Functional items are in fact outside of the scope of copyright protection.  As a result, if they are not protected by patent they are largely in the public domain.  However, not all physical items are functional items.  Many sculptural or decorative items are well within the scope of copyright protection and have been for some time.  Again, see 17 U.S.C. (a)(5).<br/></p><p><b>3. “In order for individuals to keep a patent, copyright, or most other
IP valid, they have to take reasonable steps to prevent other
individuals from infringing on their IP. Even if one assumes that, in
the future, a court finds CAD files/derivatives thereof copyrightable
(which is highly unlikely), individuals who post said designs online for
 anyone and everyone to download are doing the exact opposite of taking
reasonable steps to protect their IP.”</b><br/></p><p>Let’s set aside the question of if you need to take reasonable steps to protect your IP rights in order to maintain them.  In the vast majority of cases this is not the case, but I can think of enough lawyerly caveats that I want to avoid the digression.  <br/></p><p>Fortunately, I can dodge that question entirely because thingiverse designers are not posting “designs online for anyone and everyone to download.”  Well, at last that isn’t all they are doing.  Thingiverse designers are making their works available to the public <i>explicitly conditioned on a license</i>.  While the terms of the license may be different, as a legal tool it is identical to what governs every movie available for streaming on netflix.  If, for the sake of argument, it is required to take steps to protect your copyright in order to maintain it, distributing works with a license strikes me as a completely reasonable step to protect your copyright.</p><p><b>4. “Some claim that the Creative Commons license protects designers who
upload their CAD creations online. This is false. The CC license
directly contradicts existing United States IP law and has never been
challenged in a United States Court (in the entire world, it has been
involved in 10 cases-<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Law-" target="_blank">https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Law-</a> and in these cases it was either not even discussed or existing IP law/precedent was used instead of the CC license).”</b></p><p>I’ve never read an argument as to why CC licenses “directly contradict[] existing United States IP law” so I don’t really understand where it is coming from.  If someone has a link I’m happy to add it here.  In fact, CC licenses were explicitly designed to use existing US IP law to make sharing easier and do a pretty solid job of that.  If the model is protectable by copyright (see 1 above), a CC license is as valid as any other.</p><p>5. <b>This point, which I am summarizing from a long paragraph, is essentially that 3D printing has grown in large part because of the expiration of patents on the printers themselves, and that somehow copyright on 3D models would impact this.  In the spirit of fairness I’m going to quote the point in its entirety now:</b></p><blockquote><p> The biggest reason that 3D printing, and the online design community
that supplies CAD models for 3D printing, has taken off in the
incredible way it has these last few years is because the main/most
fundamental patents relating to 3D printers expired in the early 2000s
and a wealth of innovation poured into the space with 500+ companies
producing cheap, consumer friendly 3D printers instead of five companies
 producing $20,000+ printers. Imagine a world where the patent holders
claimed that the physical innovations they came up with, or the computer
 files used to create said items, were &ldquo;works of art&rdquo;/copyrightable. In
this world, 3D printers would not be widely available to the public
until 2050 or later. If this was true, what is to stop other
manufacturers from also claiming their products are &ldquo;works of
art&rdquo;/copyrightable? New drugs, technologies, and all physical products
would be granted a government-protected monopoly that would extend to
the current age of Mickey Mouse. Considering that we, and online
designers, are only partaking of the 3D printing renaissance because of
the United States reasonable policy of allowing innovations to be open
to the public after a patent expires, it is incredibly ironic that
members of this same community would spit on this tradition in favor of
extending an extremely long government monopoly on all physical
products. So, in the best interest of the community, we hope that the
public, and courts, will agree with us and prevent CAD models from being
 inherently copyrightable-or the consequences will be incredibly severe.</p></blockquote><p>I totally agree that a big part of the explosion of 3D printing has to do with the expiration of patents on 3D printers themselves.  I have no idea why copyright protecting individual 3D models has is impacted by that observation one way or the other.  Again, if someone can flesh it out I’m happy to link it here.</p><p><b>6. “We have found that the vast majority of designers who post their designs
 to sites like Thingiverse.com do not care about their monetization
(after all, in uploading them to Thingiverse they are granting the
site&rsquo;s owner/public traded Israeli company Stratasys, Inc. a license to
do what they will with the design), but would like to be credited/linked
 whenever the design is used. We, and most others, are happy to do this.
 The only issue is that eBay, Amazon, Etsy, etc. block us from putting
links in our listings to external sites (with select few exceptions). We
 are currently working with eBay, others to see if this can be changed.
Until such a time, all we can do is have a plain text reference.“</b></p><p>This does not appear to be the response that they gave designers who contacted them about crediting the design in compliance with the license.  If they are now complying with the BY provision of the CC license, that’s a great thing.  However, if the CC license also has a non-commercial restriction then credit alone isn’t enough to comply.  They could certainly get an additional license to sell the model commercially, but that license is not implied simply by putting the model up on thingiverse.</p><p><b>7. The next three points are drawn from Just 3D Print’s response in thingiverse comments. I’m just going to summarize them because you can read the entire text <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1350837/#comment-801359" target="_blank">here</a>.  The first point is that this is only coming to light because a competitor emailed designers to give them a heads up about Just 3D Print’s behavior.</b></p><p>I don’t see how that point is relevant at all.  If Just 3D Print is violating the copyright of designers, the fact that the designer did not know about it until they were tipped off does not change the infringement.  The fact that other parties may be infringing in similar ways is also irrelevant.  Designers are free to pick and choose who to go after for infringement.</p><p><b>8. I can quote this one because it is short: “Yes, all photographs are copyrighted by their
 creators, but in order to defend a picture/tell people not to use it,
it must be registered with the U.S. copyright office. “</b></p><p>This is false.  Helpfully, the US Copyright Office <a href="http://copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#register" target="_blank">has a FAQ question that is exactly on point</a>.  While you may  need to register your copyright in order to bring an infringement lawsuit, your copyright can still be infringed prior to registration.  Copying a copyright-protected photo outside of the scope of a license (absent fair use) is going to infringe upon the copyright in the photo regardless of its registration status. In other words, you can tell people not to use your photos without registering them.  (This actually creates a huge issue with what are know as “<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/" target="_blank">orphan works</a>,” but boy if you think I’m going to make this post any longer by writing about that you have another thing coming.) <br/></p><p><b>9. To summarize the last point I’ll address in this post, thingiverse violates the noncommercial restrictions on the licenses so the licenses are invalid.</b></p><p>Two reasons that this is wrong.  First, thingiverse is not bound by the terms of the CC licenses because designers have a separate agreement with thingiverse.  When you sign up for a thingiverse account you agree to terms and conditions, and those terms and conditions govern how thingiverse can use your models.  There is nothing improper about having different licenses for the same work.  To go back to the example I used yesterday, the license that allows HBO to stream Mad Max to its subscribers is very different from the license that allows me as a subscriber to view Mad Max.</p><p>Second, the fact that someone else is violating a license generally does not give everyone else permission to violate the license.</p><p><br/></p><hr><p>If you made it this far, thank you I guess?  I’m bothering to write this because as 3D printing and design grows I think it is important for everyone to have a strong understanding of what is - and is not - protected by various types of copyright.  Hopefully it is of some use to some people.  As I mentioned yesterday, I’ll do my best to update this post or add a new post as more info becomes public.  Finally, if you think I missed something or got something wrong, don’t be shy.  There are public and private ways to get in touch on my <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/about" target="_blank">about page</a>.  Send me a link to all of the reasons you think I am dumb.</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Image: <strike><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1350837" target="_blank">Sad Face!
