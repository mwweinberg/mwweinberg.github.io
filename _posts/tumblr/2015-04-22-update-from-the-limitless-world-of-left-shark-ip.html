<p>Many of you will likely remember that shortly after the Super Bowl there was a <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/19920-left-sharks-back-alright.html" target="_blank">bit of a thing</a>
 here on Shapeways in connection with a model of Left Shark.  To briefly
 review and condense the timeline: person awkwardly dancing inside shark
 costume during the halftime show <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/super-bowl-xlix-halftime-shark" target="_blank">rockets to internet fame</a>.  Designer Fernando Sosa creates 3D model of the newly christened “Left Shark” and starts <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/product/PHEKBV6E2/left-shark" target="_blank">selling it on Shapeways</a>.  Katy Perry’s lawyers send Shapeways a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/254849521/Left-Shark-cease-and-desist" target="_blank">nastygram</a> asserting rights in Left Shark.  Fernando Sosa <a href="http://politicalsculptor.blogspot.com/2015/02/politicalsculptor-retains-legal.html" target="_blank">responds</a>, questioning if Katy Perry has any rights in Left Shark at all.  Left Shark makes its <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/19920-left-sharks-back-alright.html" target="_blank">triumphant return</a> to Shapeways.  (In a B story that foreshadows today’s news, Katy Perry then <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150211/12073529990/cant-make-this-up-katy-perrys-lawyers-use-left-shark-photo-taken-guy-theyre-threatening-trademark-application.shtml" target="_blank">uses Sosa’s Left Shark as part of her trademark application</a>).</p><p>Today the Left Shark IP story that never ends added a new chapter.  As was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-32415267" target="_blank">widely reported</a>, Katy Perry’s application to register the Left Shark costume as a trademark was <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86529321&amp;docId=OOA20150417131620#docIndex=0&amp;page=1" target="_blank">denied</a> by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).  What does this actually mean?</p><p>As attorney Mark H. Jaffe (who has been all over the trademark angle of this story on twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkJKings/status/590862062651183104" target="_blank">reminded us this morning</a>,
 this refusal by the PTO is an initial refusal. That means that Katy 
Perry still has an opportunity to respond, and to modify her application
 in order to improve its chances of being approved.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that trademark is 
different from copyright.  Trademark is all about helping consumers 
match a service to a service provider.  That means that a big part of 
getting a trademark is showing that people use it to identify your 
services or goods, and to distinguish them from other services or goods 
in the marketplace.</p><p>Enough with the background – what actually happened?</p><p>Katy Perry (well, Katy Perry’s company Killer Queen LLC) 
applied to use the Left Shark costume as a trademark to identify Katy 
Perry-related goods and services in the marketplace.  In <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86529321&amp;docId=OOA20150417131620#docIndex=0&amp;page=1" target="_blank">refusing the application</a>,
 the examiner essentially found that Left Shark does not identify Katy 
Perry’s “musical or dance performances” in the marketplace. 
 Essentially, the examiner found that Left Shark represents Left Shark 
and not Katy Perry to consumers.  When people see Left Shark figurines, 
or Left Shark on cell phone covers, mugs, and sweatshirts, they don’t 
think “Katy Perry.”   They think “Left Shark.”</p><p>Now Katy Perry has some time to respond to the PTO for both
 the costume registration and the words “Left Shark.”  Until she does, 
and until the PTO accepts the marks, Katy Perry does not have a 
trademark in Left Shark.</p><p>Surely the legal machinations surrounding Left Shark will 
outlast the half-life of Left Shark’s fame by a few orders of magnitude.
   So keep your eyes on the Shapeways blog for all of the latest news.</p>
