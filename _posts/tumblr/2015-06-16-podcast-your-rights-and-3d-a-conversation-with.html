<a href="http://digitalsculpting.net/2015/05/your_rights_and_3d/">Podcast -Your Rights and 3D, A conversation with Shapeways about IP</a><br/><p>Bridgette Mongeon had me on to talk about 3D printing and IP from a designer’s perspective.  It was interesting (for me) to get into the kinds of concerns that professional sculptors have with services like Shapeways in terms of security and accessibility of support.</p>
