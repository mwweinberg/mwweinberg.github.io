<p><em>A Creative Commons license on a 3D printed sculpture does not mean that you can print it however you want.</em></p>
<hr><p><img border="0" src="/images/2013-06-19-3d-printed-copyright-infringement-is-still.html0.jpg" width="270"/>The past few days have seen an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/dizingof/status/342747803363201024" target="_blank">increase</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/make:40039" target="_blank">in</a><a href="https://twitter.com/tblatt/status/346280507081912320" target="_blank">complaints</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>by 3D printing designers about how companies that manufacture 3D printers use their designs.  It raises questions about how copyright works in the world of 3D printing, and what it means to release designs under a Creative Commons license.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br/><br/><strong>Copyright Still Exists in 3D Printing</strong><br/><br/>One of the things that makes 3D printing so interesting is that, especially when compared to the world of music and movies, lots of 3D printed objects are not protected by copyright (or any type of intellectual property right)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/16/3d-printing-can-turbocharge-mashup-culture/" target="_blank">at all</a>.  However, the fact that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>many</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3D printed things are not protected by copyright does not mean that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>all</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>3D printed things are not protected by copyright. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br/><br/>While the line between what is protected and what is not can be a bit complicated sometimes (<a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/Copyright-3DPrinting" target="_blank">here</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>is a whitepaper to help you with the details), there is a fairly straightforward rule of thumb: purely artistic things are probably going to be protected by copyright, while purely functional things are probably not going to be protected by copyright.<br/><br/><strong>Sculptures are Artistic</strong><br/><br/>Obvious members of that “purely artistic” category are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26567" target="_blank">abstract sculptures</a>.  Just because they are created in a virtual CAD environment or were designed with 3D printing in mind does not prevent them from being protected by copyright.  And that copyright comes with certain protections and rights. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br/><br/>The most obvious of those rights is the right to decide who gets to copy or reproduce the sculpture.  If you want to copy a sculpture that is protected by copyright, you either need permission from the person who owns the copyright or a reason not to need permission like fair use.<br/><br/>Copying that sculpture without permission can get expensive.  Copyright law lets a court<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504" target="_blank">assume damages up to $150,000 per work</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>if the infringement is willful.  The person who owns the copyright does not even have to prove damages – she can just point to the number in the law and demand that much.<br/><br/><strong>Creative Commons is Permission, but not Permission to Do Whatever You Want</strong><br/><br/>If you own a copyright, you can condition your permission (your “license”) on pretty much whatever you want. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>has created a collection of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">licenses</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that lets people condition permission to copy on a handful of easy-to-understand factors.  Copy all you want,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">but give me attribution</a>.  Copy all you want,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" target="_blank">but give me attricution and make your copies available in the same way to everyone</a>.  Copy all you want,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/" target="_blank">as long as you give me credit and it is not for a commercial purpose</a>. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br/><br/>As long as you comply with the license, you are copying with permission and not infringing on copyright.  But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><span>if you copy without complying with the license you are infringing on copyright</span>.  That is just as true for things with Creative Commons licenses as it is with any other thing protected by copyright.  And remember, copyright infringement can get expensive.<br/><br/><strong>Which Brings us to Trade Shows and 3D Printing Companies</strong><br/><br/>One of the most impressive things to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHIRyVwG7PQ" target="_blank">watch is a 3D printer print a really cool abstract sculpture</a>. Besides being an interesting process, some abstract sculptures – especially ones that contain shapes you have not seen before or that are hard to make with traditional manufacturing techniques – help people understand the potential of 3D printing.  Because of that, it is not a surprise that 3D printer manufactures often use abstract sculptures to show off their machines at trade shows and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/make:39714" target="_blank">other promotional events</a>.<br/><br/>But remember, printing an abstract sculpture is creating a copy.  If that sculpture is protected by copyright, in order to create a copy those companies need a license.  For example, if the license is a Creative Commons attribution license, they need to give the designer credit (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8174" target="_blank">here’s</a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>an easy way to do that).  Without credit, those copies infringe on the designer’s copyright.<br/><br/>And if the license is a Creative Commons non-commercial license, it is a bad idea for these companies to exclusively rely on that license for permission to print it at a trade show or in advertising.  While what constitutes commercial and non-commercial use<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Defining_Noncommercial" target="_blank">can sometimes get trick</a>y in the context of Creative Commons, a trade show or an ad for a commercial product is a pretty straightforward commercial use.<br/><br/>None of this means that it is impossible for 3D printing companies to feature Creative Commons non-commercial-licensed designs at trade shows or in commercials.  It just means that those companies cannot solely rely on the offered Creative Commons licenses to do so.  Instead, they need to reach out to designers and negotiate a new license that allows them to use the designs commercially.<br/><br/><strong>What Happens if Copying Continues?</strong><br/><br/>What can a designer do if they see a design being used in a way that does not comply with the generally available license?  Ultimately that is up to them.  The best thing to do is probably to reach out to the company and try and negotiate a license.  But if that fails, there is always a copyright lawsuit.  $150,000 worth of damages (per work) tends to get the attention of even the biggest 3D printer manufacturer.</p>
