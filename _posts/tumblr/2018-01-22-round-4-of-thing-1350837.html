appears that we have arrived at round 4 of Just 3D Print vs The
World.  In this round, Just 3D Print is bringing a new lawsuit* (it
lost the last one) against the media company <a href="http://3drholdings.com/" target="_blank">3DR Holdings</a> for
reporting on Just 3D Print’s shenanigans.  The tl;dr version of
this round is that Just 3D Print has brought no new evidence to the
table and its claims this time seem just as big of a waste of time in
Round 4 as they did in <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2017-07-22-round-3-of-thing-1350837.html" target="_blank">Round 3</a>.  There do not appear to be any
good reasons left to continue this lawsuit, although there are potentially one or
two bad ones (see below).</p><p>The deep background
is <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2017-07-22-round-3-of-thing-1350837.html" target="_blank">here</a>, but at this point the short version is: Just 3D Print
downloaded hundreds of models from Thingivese and, in violation of
their licenses, started selling 3D prints of the models on eBay. 
This resulted in pushback from the community and media coverage. 
After the models were removed from eBay, Just 3D Print commenced a
number of lawsuits against media outlets that covered the drama.  The
lawsuits claimed that the negative coverage cost Just 3D Print  a $100,000,000 business.  Courts that addressed the merits of Just 3D Print’s
claims have all ruled against Just 3D Print.  Courts came to this
conclusion because, among other things, we are in America and
reporting on public behavior and having opinions about public
controversies is not illegal.</p><p>3DR Holdings owns
websites like <a href="https://3dprint.com/" target="_blank">3DPrint.com</a> and <a href="http://3dprintingindustry.com/" target="_blank">3DPrintingIndustry.com</a>.  Just 3D Print
sued 3DR for its coverage of the dispute.  Just 3D Print claimed that 3DR defamed
Just 3D Print by reporting on the controversy surrounding the
Thingverse/eBay models and that the defamation caused Just 3D Print
damage (mostly in the form of lost business opportunities and sales).
In Round 3 of this dispute, a court <a href="https://archive.org/details/justprintit-v-3dholdings" target="_blank">found</a> that 3DR did not defame Just 3D Print because 1)
3DR’s post was not defamatory, and 2) even if they were defamatory,
Just 3D Print failed to prove that 3DR’s actions were in any way
related to any harm experienced by Just 3D Print.  The court did not
need to determine if any copyright infringement actually occurred in
the underlying dispute in order to reach this conclusion.</p><p>That
original case was in Philadelphia Municipal Court and was resolved in
August of 2017.  As
best as I can tell, Municipal Court
appears to be the local equivalent of small claims court.** In
October of 2017 Just 3D Print filed a <a href="https://archive.org/details/2017.12.22PreliminaryObjectionsToAmendedComplaint1" target="_blank">new case</a> against 3DR in the
Court of Common Pleas, which appears to be the PA civil court. 
According to the Municipal Court’s <a href="https://www.courts.phila.gov/municipal/" target="_blank">website</a> anyone involved in a case in Municipal Court can appeal the decision
to the Court of Common Pleas for a trial <i>de novo</i>.  <i>De novo</i> means that
the Court of Common Pleas will reexamine the facts of the case itself
instead of just relying on the factual conclusions of the Municipal
Court.  Again
according to the Municipal Court’s website, less than 3% of cases
in Municipal Court are appealed up to the more formal Court of Common
Pleas.</p><h2><b>The
New Complaint</b></h2><p>
The
original <a href="https://archive.org/details/J3DV3DRComplaint" target="_blank">complaint</a> in Municipal Court by Just 3D Print is short enough to easily
reproduce here:</p><blockquote><p>
ON
FEBRUARY 21, 2016 THE PLAINTIFF STATES THE DEFENDANT PUBLISHED AN
ARTICLE ON LINE (PLEASE SEE ATTACHED EXHIBIT). THE PLAINTIFF STATES
THAT THE ARTICLE CONTAINED FALSE AND DEFAMATORY IN NATURE
INFORMATION. DUE TO THIS ARTICLE, THAT PLAINTIFF&rsquo;S COMPANY LOST
PROJECTED REVENUE IN EXCESS OF</p><p>
$100,000,000.00.
THE PLAINTIFF HAS CONTACTED THE DEFENDANT VIA MAIL TO ATTEMPT TO
RESOLVE THIS MATTER TO NO AVAIL. THE PLAINTIFF IS AWARE OF OUR
JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT OF $12,000.00 AND FORFEITS ANY AND ALL MONIES
OVER THIS AMOUNT. THE PLAINTIFF NOW SEEKS A JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF
$12000.00 PLUS COURT COSTS.</p></blockquote><p>
The
 new complaint makes essentially the same sets of claims in
full-blown-civil-complaint form, which means that it is long enough
that I’ll just link to it <a href="https://archive.org/details/2017.12.22PreliminaryObjectionsToAmendedComplaint1" target="_blank">here</a>.  Once again, Just 3D Print
claims that 3DR’s articles about Just 3D Print’s antics cost it a
thriving business.  As a result, Just 3D Print is asking the court to
award it $150,000 in damages ($50,000 each for defamation, unfair
trade practices, and tortuous interference. All three of these claims
are attempts to show that the same original reporting caused trouble
for Just 3D Print under slightly different legal theories).</p><h2><b>Is
There Anything New Here?</b></h2><p>
I
could spend another few thousand words working through these claims,
talking about the procedural fights they contain and why the entire
case  may be dismissed without a substantive decision by the court
because Just 3D Print may have failed to follow various
administrative rules, but my and your life is finite so I won’t. 
This is basically another round of the same dance that we saw in
Round 3 moved to a slightly larger court.  That means that the <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2017-07-22-round-3-of-thing-1350837.html" target="_blank">post
outlining Round 3</a> takes care of most of the substance.</p><p>
At
this point I have no idea what purpose this case is serving.  It does
seem to be effective at wasting a lot of people’s time.  It is also
starting to develop the characteristics of the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170613/21220237581/chilling-effects-slapp-suit-my-story.shtml" target="_blank">types of cases</a> that
are brought to intimidate critics and find scapegoats for the failure
of stupid business ideas.  Without even getting to the question of if
there was copyright infringement or not, two courts have already
concluded that the reporting in question here is not the type of
behavior that can trigger defamation.  Just 3D Print does not appear
to have found any new evidence to call that basic conclusion into
question or any substantive reason why those courts are incorrect.</p><p>
Even
if a court came to a different conclusion – a change that would
strike me as unreasonable without some sort of unexpected additional
evidence – in the <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2017-07-22-round-3-of-thing-1350837.html" target="_blank">Round 3 post</a> I explained why 1) there does
not actually seem to be a link between any of the reporting in
question and the models being taken down by eBay, which is nominally
how the harm was caused, and 2) if the public facts are correct it is
pretty clear to me that Just 3D Print did infringe on a number of
copyrights.  Oh, also, $100,000,000 in lost business opportunities?</p><h2><b>Why
Does This Matter?</b></h2><p>
In
the previous post I wrote that I’ve been following this case
because 
</p><blockquote><p>“we
are still in a formative time in the context of 3D printing,
copyright, and Creative Commons licensing. While there is some
ambiguity, there isn’t total ambiguity.  Throwing settled areas of
copyright law into question does not help work towards a solution for
the complicated stuff. When there are legitimate disagreements about
the intersection of 3D printing, copyright, and Creative Commons
licenses, they are important to explore. But if someone is bringing
dubious claims into a discussion it is important to identify them as
such as quickly as possible.”<br/></p></blockquote><p>That’s
still true.  However at this point it seems like this case is also
evolving into an example of someone trying to use the legal system to
discourage criticism they do not like, or to
suppress discussions of
events they wish were not widely discussed.  Just 3D Print has every
right to bring these cases if it believes that it has been wronged. 
Similarly I
– and 3DR and anyone
else for that matter – has every right to report
on Just 3D Print’s antics and to clearly
state that they think that Just 3D Print is abusing the legal system
to harass a critic and pass
the blame.  Which
I’ll do now: I believe that Just 3D Print is abusing the legal
system to harass a critic and pass the blame for the failure of its
incredibly ill conceived business onto anyone
else.</p><p>
To
the extent that there is a Round 5 of this case (and
boy do I hope there is not),
my
guess that it will finally move
beyond the copyright questions – the answers to those are pretty
clear.  Instead,
any Round 5 will likely be about Just 3D Print trying to find new
ways to harass critics and justify its bad behavior via lawsuit. 
That’s something I
wouldn’t usually write about here, but I guess at this point I’m
in for a penny, in for a pound.</p><p>
As
always, I’ll update this post if and when there is additional
information.  If you have such information, <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/about" target="_blank">contact me</a> however

seems like a good place to reiterate once again that I am in no way
an expert in Pennsylvania law or the structure of its courts.  Like
anything I write in relation to this case, this post is my personal
best understanding and opinion but should not be confused with a
statement of legal fact.  It also isn’t legal advice.  I’ll
update this post as the inevitable errors emerge.</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Sad face image courtesy of Loubie</i>.<br/></p>
