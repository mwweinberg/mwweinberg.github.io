<p>News <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/09/court-groups-3d-printer-gun-files-must-stay-offline-for-now/" target="_blank">broke today</a> that there was a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3111635-15-50759-Documents.html#document/p10/a318919" target="_blank">decision</a> in the case that <a href="https://defdist.org/" target="_blank">Defense Distributed</a> is bringing against the State Department related to putting files for 3D printing and CNC milling guns online.  While this is a decision on a preliminary question that largely punts on the super-interesting parts of this case, it still has a few noteworthy elements.</p><p>As a quick bit of background, Defense Distributed released
some files for 3D printed guns online. 
The State Department sent them a letter telling Defense Distributed that
under the State Department’s interpretation of export laws known as ITAR,
Defense Distributed had to pre-clear the posting of such files with State. The theory is
that posting the files on the internet is the same as exporting them to foreign
nationals.</p><p>While complying with State’s request, Defense Distributed
sued the State Department over their interpretation of ITAR, claiming that the interpretation
was unconstitutional.  Before getting to
the real heart of the case, Defense Distributed asked the court to suspend the
State Department’s pre-clearance requirement until the matter was
resolved.  It is that request – which took
the form of a preliminary injunction request – that resulted in the decision
this week.  That means that the decision
today is not about the larger questions surrounding files as free speech, what
qualifies as “exporting” a digital thing, and when information becomes a thing.</p><p>The arguments around the preliminary injunction can be
summarized quickly.  Defense Distributed
said that imposing a prior restraint on its ability to speak (in the form of
releasing files) infringed on its First Amendment rights (among other
things).  The State Department said that
releasing files online harmed national security.</p><p>The majority opinion essentially took the claims of both
sides at face value.  Defense Distributed
had Constitutional rights that could only be infringed upon in important
circumstances.  The State Department was
showing a circumstance which, if it prevailed at trial, could very well be important enough to justify
infringing on those rights.</p><p>The majority was swayed because of what it saw as the long
term impact of those harms.  If Defense
Distributed turned out to be right, the harm caused by preventing it from
posting the files online could be remedied at the end of the trial (and its
appeals….) by allowing them to post the files online (note: it is probably safe
to say that this is not a universally accepted theory of how to remedy the harms related to
prior restraint). </p><p>However, if the State Department turned out to be right, the
harm caused by temporarily allowing Defense Distributed to post the files
online could not be reversed.  This is because once a
file is online it is online forever, even if Defense Distributed took them off the
Defense Distributed site.  On this narrow
point, this is a refreshingly clear-eyed understanding of how the internet
works from a court.</p><p>As a result of this balancing, the majority sided with the State Department
and declined to allow Defense Distributed to post the files pending the resolution
of the case.</p><p>The dissenting opinion took a very different view. I suspect
that, while Defense Distributed would have preferred to win this round, they
are at least happy with the fairly long and detailed dissent opinion.</p><p>Instead of taking the State Department’s claim that posting
the files online negatively impacts national security at face value, Judge
Jones’ dissenting opinion interrogates the claim and finds it sorely
lacking.  It questions the
constitutionality of the ITAR framework generally, and rejects the way that the
State Department interprets it in this case specifically. 
After undermining the State Department’s argument over the course of a number of pages, it is unsurprising
that the opinion sides with Defense Distributed’s constitutional claims and
argues in favor of its ability to post the files online.</p><p>This opinion may very well be appealed. If it is, the full 5<sup>th</sup>
Circuit will have to decide which analytic approach to take, and then how that
approach applies. Even when that process is over, the parties will have to go
back and actually argue the heart of the case (which, regardless of your
opinions about gun control, 3D printing, free speech, and export control law,
raises some interesting questions).  In
other words, this decision is one among many before all of the questions are
answered. </p><p>That being said, the opinion is an interesting window into how courts will approach the many potentially complicated legal questions connected to this case.  Since Defense Distributed has partnered with the Second Amendment Foundation to pursue this case, there is actually a reasonably good chance that that the case will last long enough to get some of them answered.</p>
