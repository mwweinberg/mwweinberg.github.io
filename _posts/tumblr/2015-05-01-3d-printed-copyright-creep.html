<p><i>This article <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150427/10532430809/3d-printed-copyright-creep.shtml" target="_blank">first appeared</a> in Techdirt on April 28, 2015</i>.</p><p>When your car runs out of gas, you can fill it up at any gas station you
 like. You never worry if the company that made your car has an 
exclusivity deal with one gas station or another, or even if that 
company has a preference for one brand of gas. In fact, you would 
probably find it some combination of ridiculous, galling, and offensive 
if the company that made your car threatened you with a copyright 
infringement lawsuit if you didn&rsquo;t go to their preferred gas station to 
fill up.
<br/><br/>
This dynamic is true for all sorts of things. Once you buy it, it is up 
to you to decide how you maintain it and replace what needs replacing. 
This is true of gas in a car, water in a bottle, and filters in a vacuum
 cleaner. But as software gets introduced into more and more everyday 
objects, some companies are trying to stretch copyright law beyond its 
limit in order to lock you into buying replacements only from them.
<br/><br/>
A decade ago, we saw this play out with 2D printers and toner ink. Some 
companies that made printers decided that they would prefer that 
consumers buy replacement toner (at a substantial markup) only from 
them. In order to attempt to lock themselves in as the only place to buy
 replacement toner, these companies designed their printers to look for a
 special verification chip on new toner cartridges to prove that the new
 cartridge came from them. When another company figured out a way around
 these chips, the printer manufacturers ran to copyright law to try and 
shut them down.
<br/><br/>
Fortunately, the courts <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041026/103208.shtml" target="_blank">saw through this ruse</a>
 and were able to recognize that allowing consumers to choose where they
 get replacement toner for their printers has nothing to do with 
copyright law. Unfortunately, today some 3D printer manufacturers are 
trying this same gambit and hoping for a different outcome.
<br/><br/>
In a <a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/comments-032715/" target="_blank">proceeding in front of the Copyright Office</a>, 3D printer manufacturers offer <a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/comments-032715/class%2026/STRATASYS_Class26_1201_2014.pdf" target="_blank">a parade of horribles of what will happen</a>
 [pdf] if users are free to choose the materials they use in their 
printers. Notably, none of these have anything to do with copyright. The
 only connection any of this has with copyright is that the printer 
manufacturers use a small line of code to verify if they sold the 
refills.
<br/><br/>
Just as adding a verification chip to a gas tank shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a 
pretext to lock a car owner into a single source of gasoline, adding a 
verification chip shouldn&rsquo;t be used as a pretext to lock a 3D printer 
user into a single source of 3D printing material.
<br/><br/>
3D printing is an emerging engine for innovation, and because of that 
this issue would be important even in isolation. However, the battle 
being fought over 3D printer material occurs against the backdrop of 
other attempts to use copyright as a pretext to limit consumer choice in
 all sorts of contexts. Be it accessing data from medical devices 
implanted in your body, repairing farm equipment that breaks down in the
 field, or unlocking your cell phone, the current proceeding before the 
Copyright Office – known as the &ldquo;1201 triennial&rdquo; after the part of the 
law that created it – is a preview of a future where manufacturers have 
the power to lock consumers into whatever they please.
<br/><br/>
That is what makes the Registrar of Copyrights&rsquo; decisions so important 
in this proceeding. Not only will the right decision clear the way for 
consumer choice. Strongly siding with users and against copyright 
creeping into everything sends a strong message that copyright has its 
purpose, but that it should not be abused.
