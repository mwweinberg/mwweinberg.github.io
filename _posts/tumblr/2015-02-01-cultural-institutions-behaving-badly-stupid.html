quality 3D scans available to the public.  Unfortunately, just as long 
summer days must turn to cold winter nights, we now have an example of a
 different cultural institution doing a fantastic job of setting an 
example of how not to handle the same types of issues.<br/></p><p><b>Scene: Sioux Falls, South Dakota</b></p><p>Sioux Falls is home to a high quality cast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_%28Michelangelo%29" target="_blank">Michelangelo’s Moses</a>,
 one of his best-known sculptures.*  The cast itself co-owned by the 
City of Sioux Falls and Augustana College and is on public display on 
the campus of Augustana College. </p><p>Local photographer Jerry Fisher decided to use the sculpture as his 
subject while he honed his 3D capture skills, documenting his progress 
on Twitter and Google +.  Unfortunately, this completely reasonable and 
legal act caught the attention of representatives of Augustana College. 
 Citing an unspecified (and ultimately nonexistent) mixture of copyright
 and other intellectual property rights concerns, the College asked 
Fisher to remove his 3D files from the internet.  Fearing some sort of 
liability, Fisher complied with this groundless request, thus depriving 
himself and everyone else of the opportunity to use the files.</p><p><b>Augustana College’s Request Was Out of Line - The Public Domain is Real</b></p><figure class=""><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/369e88b78207ad90e83ade30e120bc2c/tumblr_inline_nj46nlSqLu1rl4bdh.jpg"/></figure><p>Let’s get one thing out of the way right now: Augustana College had 
no legal right or basis to threaten Fisher with the specter of 
infringement.  There is no copyright protection for a sculpture that was
 created at the dawn of the 16<sup>th</sup> century by a sculptor who 
died 450 years ago.  All of Michelangelo’s work is firmly in the public 
domain.  If fact, copyright didn’t even exist during Michelangelo’s 
lifetime.  From the moment he sculpted his Moses anyone could copy, 
remix, and build upon it for any reason, without having to ask 
permission.</p><p>Of course, the sculpture in Sioux Falls is not Michelangelo’s 
original sculpture.  The original Moses is still in Italy.  The Sioux 
Falls sculptures are exact replicas made in the early 1970s - exact 
replicas, it seems appropriate to mention, that were made without 
permission of Michelangelo’s estate because the originals are not 
protected by copyright.  There was no copyright on the original 
sculpture, and there is no copyright in the exact copies of the original
 sculpture.</p><p>If Fisher were practicing his 3D scanning on original sculptures made
 in the early 1970s, the sculptures would likely still be protected by 
copyright.  Fortunately for Fisher and everyone else, the sculpture in 
question is not an original sculpture – it is a copy.  Just as scanning a
 16<sup>th</sup> century map doesn’t give me a new copyright in the scan file, casting a copy of a 16<sup>th</sup> century sculpture doesn’t give me a new copyright in the cast. </p><p>The Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at Boston Public Library 
scanned this 16th century map, but doing so did not give the library a 
new copyright in their scan</p><figure class="" style=""><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/8b90225e22c9ba39f45fae4e87e81396/tumblr_inline_nj46o2VYt11rl4bdh.jpg"/></figure><p>Without a copyright in the original sculpture or the reproduction, 
there is simply no copyright reason that Fisher shouldn’t be able to 
make as many scans as he likes.  It is irresponsible, and undermines 
Augustana’s <a href="http://www.augie.edu/mission-values-and-vision" target="_blank">mission to “enrich[] lives by exposure to enduring forms of aesthetic and creative expressions,</a>” for Augustana to suggest otherwise. </p><p><b>3D Scanning is Not Magic</b></p><p><br/></p><figure class="" style=""><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/44feef182a118bab8252fa5994c4485a/tumblr_inline_nj46ojbCaH1rl4bdh.jpg"/></figure><p>On some level, the college recognizes that they do not have the right
 to restrict copies of their Moses cast.  People take photographs of the
 sculptures all the time, but the college does not assert an imaginary 
copyright interest and request that those pictures be destroyed.  But 
somehow, a 3D scan – just as much a copy from a copyright standpoint as a
 photo - raised novel and inarticulable concerns with College officials.
   Fortunately for everyone who is not Augustana College, 3D scanning is
 not magic and does not give Augustana College or anyone else the right 
to steal works out of the public domain.</p><p><b>How Did This Happen?</b></p><p>In all likelihood, Augustana College was not acting maliciously when 
they told Fisher to take down the files, and did not realize that they 
were doing anything wrong.  This case has all of the hallmarks of a type
 of lawyer-itus (or quasi-lawyer-itus), that tends to manifest itself 
around copyright.  Representatives for the College had a vague concern 
that the scanning might possibly infringe on someone’s copyright or 
trademark or something, and that somehow the College could be 
implicated. </p><p>When faced with that vague concern, the College essentially had two 
choices.  One was to do some research in order to find out if their 
concern was actually warranted.  The second, and this is the path it 
appears they took, was to just say no, throw out scary words like 
“copyright,” shut the project down, and hope that the problem went away.</p><p>The second choice is the lazy choice and is almost always easier.  It
 takes almost no time and effort.  But it also takes away the public’s 
right to access public domain works (the same right, it should be noted,
 that allowed the casts to be made in the first place).</p><p>This type of choice between reacting and thinking is one that leaders
 at cultural institutions all over the country will be facing in the 
coming years when they start getting questions about 3D scanning.  There
 is always the temptation to say “no” and get on with your day.  But the
 better response is to take the time to really understand the issue and 
work to keep the sculptures, buildings, and objects that are in the 
public domain out of a fake copyright fog.  Copyright protection lasts 
long enough – a combination of fear and laziness should not be allowed 
to pull works out of the public domain.</p><p><b>Bonus: Today’s Copyright Laws Are Designed To Make Lawyers Overly Cautious</b></p><p>Many lawyers are cautious by nature, but there are elements of 
copyright law that give them an extra incentive to be even more cautious
 than usual.  Specifically, a quirk of copyright law can make monetary 
damages balloon unusually quickly in infringement cases.</p><p>In order to get money in most civil cases you need to show your 
damages.  Get hit by a car? Show the court your medical bills and lost 
wages.  Painter paint your wall hot pink instead of staid beige?  Show 
the court how much it cost you to get the work redone.</p><p>Copyright law is different when it comes to damages.  A copyright 
holder can sue for actual damages, just like the person hit by a car or 
with a bad paint job.  But they also have the option to sue for what are
 called “statutory damages.”  Instead of pointing to the actual cost of 
infringement (that illegal download of a song deprived the artist of 
$0.99), a copyright holder can just point to an amount that is written 
into the text of the law to serve as the value of the damages.  That 
amount can be in the six figures for a single infringement (that’s how 
infringing 24 songs can result in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records,_Inc._v._Thomas-Rasset" target="_blank">$1.5 million damages award</a>).</p><p>Among other things, the threat of these statutory damages makes 
lawyers super cautious around potential copyright infringement claims.  
Even if he was infringing, the actual cost of Fisher making unauthorized
 copies of the sculpture would likely be no more than a few hundred 
dollars (if that).  Faced with that kind of liability, a lawyer may 
decide to take a bit of a risk and err on the side of public access.  
But in the face of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of liability, a
 lawyer has to be pretty sure before saying “yes,” even if they start 
from the assumption that the work is in the public domain.  And getting 
that sure can take a lot of time.</p><p>Fortunately, there may be an opportunity to change this. Congress is 
taking a serious look at updating copyright laws during 2015, and we 
will be working hard to get statutory damages reduced or eliminated.  
That will make it easier for people to access works that are in the 
public domain by significantly reducing the cost of errors.  Keep your 
eyes open for more discussion of this in the coming months.</p><p>* It is actually home to casts of two sculptures: Moses and David.  
While this post focuses on Moses, you can rest assured that the analysis
 also applies to David.</p><p><i>Statue image credit: Jerry Fisher</i></p>
