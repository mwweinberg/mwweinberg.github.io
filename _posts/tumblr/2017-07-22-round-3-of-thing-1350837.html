this is the third post in what I suppose now qualifies as the saga of
Just 3D Print downloading hundreds of model files from Thingiverse and selling the prints on eBay (previous posts <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2016-02-19-abusing-models-on-thingiverse-or-the-plight-of.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2016-02-20-the-plight-of-thing-1350837-continued.html" target="_blank">here</a>). </p><p>This post is occasioned by a recent defamation case brought by Just 3D Print
against Stratasys in relation to Stratasys’ reporting on the saga. 
The purpose of this post is to explain what happened in that and
related cases, as well as to review the new tweaks in the underlying copyright claims.  All of the
disclaimers and facts from the earlier posts apply, especially that
this is not legal advice of any kind and that I am not an expert in
Pennsylvania civil procedure or defamation law.  This is just my take on a situation that I believe has an impact on how we
think about the combination of 3D printing, copyright, and Creative
Commons licensing.</p><p><b>A Short Bit of Background</b></p><p>The <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2016-02-19-abusing-models-on-thingiverse-or-the-plight-of.html" target="_blank">original post</a> lays out the history so far, but let me give a quick summary of how we got here.</p><p>As you may recall, this incident began when Thingiverse user loubie <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1350837" target="_blank">raised concerns</a> about the behavior of a company called Just 3D Print.  Loubie accused Just 3D Print of pulling around 2,000 models and associated images from Thingiverse to sell in an eBay store.  Just 3D Print was allegedly doing this without permission of the designers and, in at least some cases, in violation of the terms of various CC licenses on the models.  Just 3D Print responded with a litany of excuses and justifications (listed and discussed <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2016-02-20-the-plight-of-thing-1350837-continued.html" target="_blank">here</a>) essentially claiming that its behavior did not violate US copyright law.  Various designers contacted eBay to accuse Just 3D Print of infringement and the shop was eventually removed.</p><p>That would have been the end of it, except Just 3D Print then sued three publications that covered the drama for defamation.</p><p>Just 3D Print lost one case, one case is
pending (<i>edit 8/20/17: see update above</i>), and won one case against Stratasys.  Stratasys is a 3D printer company not a publication, but the suit was related to articles published on the Stratasys blog.<br/></p><p>After the Stratasys
win, Just 3D Print reached out to a number of outlets that had
covered the original incident (“outlets” being broadly defined as
it includes this blog) asking for a disclaimer on the original
articles noting that the court had found that Just 3D Print had not
infringed any copyrights.</p><p>This struck me as
strange because, assuming the public facts available were generally
correct, it appeared that Just 3D Print probably did infringe on
copyrights. It also seemed strange that the parties involved would
have litigated an entire copyright infringement lawsuit.</p><p>
Intrigued, I
decided to investigate further.  At the end of
my investigations I have  come to two conclusions.  First, that Just
3D Print’s view of how copyright applies to 3D printing files and
objects (and just operates generally) continues to be incorrect.
Second, that it is unreasonable to claim that the court in the
Stratasys case came to any conclusions regarding copyright
infringement or, for that matter, defamation.</p><p><b>The Defamation
Suits</b><br/></p><p>Before we get to the
suits, the Digital Media Law Project has a nice <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/defamation" target="_blank">background on
defamation law</a> and on <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/pennsylvania-defamation-law" target="_blank">Pennsylvania defamation law specifically</a> (the
cases were brought in Pennsylvania courts).  When thinking about
defamation cases, it is important to look at the actual words used by
the speaker and to remember that, generally speaking, the <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/substantial-truth" target="_blank">substantial
truth of those statements</a> is a defense
against those claims.  It is also worth remembering that stating opinions (as opposed to facts) is generally protected by the First Amendment, making it much less
likely that they will be considered defamatory (more <a href="http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/opinion-and-fair-comment-privileges" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>In its complaints (against <a href="https://archive.org/details/TechcrunchComplaint" target="_blank">Techcrunch</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/JPIStratasysComplaint" target="_blank">Stratasys</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/J3DV3DRComplaint" target="_blank">3DR</a>),
Just 3D Print claimed that the articles resulted in a torrent of hate
mail, wasted  hours responding to press, and a harm to Just 3D
Print’s reputation (note that if these were the result of
legitimate, fact-based criticism, it is highly unlikely that these
harms could form the basis for a defamation claim.  In other words, it is only a problem if those harms flow from defamatory conduct).</p><p>Perhaps most
impressively, Just 3D Print claimed that the defamatory articles by
TechCrunch and Stratasys caused it to shut down a product line
projected to generate $2,000,000 a month in gross profits within one
or two years.  In its claim against 3DR Holdings (publisher of the
trade publications 3Dprint.com and 3Dprintingindustry.com), this
claim is restated as projected revenue of $100,000,000.00.</p><p>The claim against
3DR has not been resolved yet (<i>edit 8<strike>7</strike>/20/17: it was resolved in 3DR’s favor - see update above</i>), so I’m going to put that aside.  If
you are curious, I’ve posted some relevant documents <a href="https://archive.org/details/J3DV3DRExA" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Techcrunch defeated
the claim Just 3D Print brought against it.  The <a href="https://archive.org/details/TechcrunchDecision" target="_blank">decision</a> gives
two reasons. First, that the statements made by Techcrunch were
opinions that did not qualify as defamation.  Second, that there was
a statute of limitations issue.  </p><p>The Techcrunch
result is what I would have expected.  The media outlets
were reporting on a public controversy involving Just 3D Print.  In
most contexts, that kind of reporting would not qualify as defamation.
 The courts did not have to spend anytime on the facts of the
underlying copyright infringement claims to reach their conclusion. 
The nature of the reporting itself meant that the inquiry could stop
there.</p><p><b>The Stratasys
Case</b></p><p>All of which made
the Stratasys case so confusing.  Stratasys lost the case, but the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/JPIStratasysJudgment" target="_blank">final dispositio</a>n does not include any sort of explanation of
why the court found against Stratasys.  It just found for Just 3D
Print.</p><p>Intriguingly, the
time stamp at the top of the document suggests that the hearing
started at 10:55 am and ended at 11:14 am.  Presumably a conclusion
that Stratasys defamed Just 3D Print would require the court to
examine the underlying copyright infringement claims and the intent
of Stratasys in publishing the piece.  After all, Just 3D Print was representing this decision
as a vindication against accusations of copyright infringement.  How
could a court get through all of that in 19 minutes?  I’m two and a
half blog posts in and I haven’t managed to get everything
straight.</p><p>Fortunately,
<a href="https://archive.org/details/JUSTPRINTVSSTRATASYSTRANSCRIPT" target="_blank">transcripts of the oral augments</a> are available from the
court.*  As is so often the case, the transcripts answer some questions and raise others.</p><p>The argument was
short, so I encourage you to take a moment to <a href="https://archive.org/details/JUSTPRINTVSSTRATASYSTRANSCRIPT" target="_blank">read them</a> yourself (I mean, you’ve already at least skimmed this much of an article about all of this stuff).  I think it is fair to say that they are not a model of
judicial clarity or efficiency.  </p><p>
The entire
discussion appears to focus on two questions.  First, the
relationship between the person who wrote the article posted on the
Stratasys website and Stratasys itself.  Second, the
necessity of Stratasys, as opposed to simply a lawyer representing
Stratasys, to be present in the courtroom.</p><p>Good eye if you noticed that neither of these
questions directly relate to the underlying allegation of copyright
infringement or the defamatory nature of the articles about those
allegations.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the court does not really even address either of these preliminary questions.  Instead, apparently frustrated by the
discussion of those questions up to that point, 19 minutes in the
court summarily cuts off the proceedings and enters a judgment for
Just 3D Print.  No real consideration of who published the article. No real consideration of who needs to be in the courtroom.  Absolutely no consideration of infringement or defamation.</p><p>The attorney for
Stratasys responds to all of this by saying “This is unbelievable”
and I’m inclined to agree.  The most charitable reading may
be that the court found for Just 3D Print on the procedural grounds
that Stratasys failed to appear.  It does not seem reasonable to
represent that the court came to a reasoned conclusion on either the
defamation claims or the underlying infringement claims.</p><p>I’ve asked
Stratasys if they plan to appeal this decision and will update this
post if I get any additional information.  </p><p><b>Was There Even
Infringement?</b></p><p>As I mentioned
earlier, this post exists because Just 3D Print reached out to
claim that the court had found that Stratasys had defamed them and that the court had found them innocent of copyright infringement.  For the reasons I just explained, this strikes me as at
least an over reading of the decision, if not an outright
mischaracterization.</p><p>More concerning to
me was that, when asked for clarification, Just 3D Print continued to
argue that no infringement could have occurred.  Many of the reasons
they put forward were identical to the ones that surfaced during the
original conflict.  I’m not in a position to know if this continued
reliance on incorrect readings of copyright law is intentional or
merely indicative of a lack of understanding.  In the interest of
brevity (ha!), I’ll just refer to the <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2016-02-20-the-plight-of-thing-1350837-continued.html" target="_blank">earlier post on this issue
that explains why I believe these claims are incorrect</a>,
specifically claim #3 that uploading a model to Thingiverse under a
Creative Commons license somehow abandons the creator’s copyright,
and claim #8 that copyright registration is required for copyright
protection to exist and that infringement cannot happen absent that
registration.</p><p>Just to clarify,
uploading a model to Thingiverse under a Creative Commons license
does not abandon your copyright interest in that model.  And you do
not need to register your copyright in order to get copyright
protection.  In fact, your unregistered copyright can be infringed
upon.</p><p><br/><b>Was There
Ever an Accusation of Infringement?</b></p><p>There is one final
argument that Just 3D Print made in the course of our discussion:
that Just 3D Print had never been accused of copyright infringement,
and that no copyright infringement has ever been proven.</p><p>At least parts of
this claim are demonstrably false.  The <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1350837" target="_blank">Thingiverse posting that
kicked this entire saga off</a> alleged facts that would constitute infringement.  The <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1350837/#comments" target="_blank">comments on
that post</a> contains other explicit accusations of infringement.  </p><p>Furthermore, the
exhibits provided to me by Just 3D Print contain over 300 allegations
of infringement that were filed against the Just 3D Print eBay shop. 
<a href="http://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/listing/create-effective-listings/vero-program.html#m17-1-tb2" target="_blank">eBay’s ”VERO” process</a> is DMCA complaint which means that, in accordance with US copyright
law, it requires allegations of infringement to be backed up by a
statement under penalty of perjury that the claims are accurate.  The
claims sworn to include “I have a good faith belief that the use of
the material in the manner complained of above is not authorized by
the Intellectual Property Owner, its agent, or the law.”  In other
words, there are over 300 instances of Just 3D Print being accused of
infringement.  These accusations complied with US copyright law and
required the accusers to stand by their accusations under penalty of
perjury.</p><p>eBay’s VERO/DMCA
process allows an eBay shop owner who is accused of infringement to
submit a counternotice and have the targeted listing reinstated. 
However, Just 3D Print did not contest a single accusation of
infringement and instead allowed the listings to be removed.  It is
important to point out that the failure to respond to a DMCA takedown
notice does not meant that the original accusation was correct. 
There are many structural reasons that make it hard or intimidating
to respond to a DMCA notice even if it is incorrect.  </p><p>When pressed on this
failure to respond – a failure that ultimately resulted in the
shutting of the eBay shop and apparently contributed to the loss of
millions of dollars of revenue – Just 3D Print replied that the
eBay “contact us” phone number simply connected them with a “random
person that says they will pass on the info.”  Regardless, the eBay
VERO/DMCA page provides explicit instructions on how to challenge an
accusation of infringement with a link to the form (no phone call required):</p><figure data-orig-width="968" data-orig-height="176" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/images/2017-07-22-round-3-of-thing-1350837.html1.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="968" data-orig-height="176"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>With tens of
millions of dollars allegedly on the line, it is unclear why Just 3D
Print failed to challenge a single accusation of infringement via the
form provided by eBay.  This is all the more confusing because Just
3D Print does not appear to have a general aversion to engaging with legal processes.</p><p>Just 3D Print’s
second response to the accusations is that it does not consider any
of the accusations to be valid because there is no evidence that the
individuals reporting infringement had registered their copyright
prior to making the accusation.  As noted above, this is not a
requirement for copyright infringement.  Furthermore, if this was
Just 3D Print’s position, it could have been communicated to eBay
and its accusers via the eBay process.</p><p>
None of this
constitutes a judicially arrived-at decision that Just 3D Print
infringed on any copyrights.  But, at a minimum, it certainly
constitutes allegations of infringement in my book.</p><p><b>Why Does This
Matter?</b></p><p>Is this post
anything more than responding to someone being <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank">wrong on the internet</a>?  </p><p>I hope so.  As I’ve
noted in the earlier posts regarding the dispute, we are still in a
formative time in the context of 3D printing, copyright, and Creative
Commons licensing.  While there is some ambiguity, there isn’t
total ambiguity.  Throwing settled areas of copyright law into
question does not help work towards a solution for the complicated
stuff.  When there are legitimate disagreements about the
intersection of 3D printing, copyright, and Creative Commons
licenses, they are important to explore.  But if someone is bringing
dubious claims into a discussion it is important to identify them as
such as quickly as possible.</p><p>As always, I’ll update these and other posts as more
information becomes available.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>*Bonus: How do
you get all of the legal documents?</b></p><p>It’s both harder than it should be and in fact not so hard.  The important thing to remember when looking up legal
documents (and this is true at all levels) is that court document
systems are not sophisticated.  Generally speaking, for every court
it seems there was a moment in the late 1990s or early 2000s where
someone decided that things should be available online.  At that
point some contractor spun up an online portal, and that portal has
never been updated since.  So when you are searching courts for
information just pretend it is 2002 and proceed accordingly.  </p><p>For the court in
this case, that means going to the <a href="https://fjdclaims.phila.gov/phmuni/login.do?desiredURL=%2Fphmuni%2Findex.jsp" target="_blank">public portal</a> and logging in as a public user.  You then need something pretty
specific (a case number, a party name) to find documents.  For the Stratasys case that number is SC-17-02-24-6077.  If you can
get a thread, you’ll end up at a docket page.  Even small cases
will have a number of documents, because this page captures
everything that happens procedurally in the case.  Fortunately the
names are at least semi-descriptive, so you can be reasonably sure
something called “Judgment” will be a judgment.</p><p>There is one thing
that is obviously missing from the docket page, and that is the
transcript.  For that I just called up the court clerk to ask for
instructions.  Courts know that their websites aren’t amazing and
court clerks are generally pretty friendly.  In this case they
happily told me how much the transcript would cost, where to send the
check, and what else to include in the envelope.  A few weeks later I
had the transcript in my inbox.</p><p><i>Sad face image courtesy of Loubie</i>.</p>
