<p><i>This post <a href="http://www.oshwa.org/2016/11/07/open-source-hardware-certification-ids-are-live/" target="_blank">originally appeared</a> on the OSHWA blog.</i></p><p>Last month at the Open Hardware Summit we <a href="http://www.oshwa.org/2016/10/07/announcing-the-oshwa-open-source-hardware-certification-program/" target="_blank">announced</a> the start of the <a href="http://certificate.oshwa.org/" target="_blank">OSHWA open source hardware certification program</a>.  Part of that program involved issuing unique IDs (UIDs) for each piece of registered hardware.  Since we knew that low numbers would be hot properties, we decided to wait until the end of October to assign them.  That allowed us to give every piece of hardware registered in the month of October a chance for the lowest possible number.</p><p>Today, thanks to the good people at <a href="https://www.random.org/" target="_blank">random.org</a>, we have assigned those UIDs to all pieces of hardware registered before the end of October.  We have also started assigning numbers sequentially for all pieces of hardware registered since November started.  You can see all of the registered hardware  <a href="http://certificate.oshwa.org/certification-directory/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>There were 60 different projects registered from 9 different countries.  Want to get your own UID?  <a href="http://certificate.oshwa.org/get-certified/" target="_blank">Register here</a>!</p>
