It was also the last big thing I wrote for PK.  The paper focuses on what parts of 3D printable objects (and files) might be protectable by IP and what happens if those parts are protected. The title is kind of a lie.  It spends much more time talking about what you might be able to license than how to license those parts after you have identified them.<br/></p><p>Download it <a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/documents/3-steps-for-licensing-your-3d-printed-stuff" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
