open source software movement and Creative Commons (collectively, for the
purposes of this post, OSS/CC).  It is probably
safe to say that OSS/CC has succeeded well beyond the wildest dreams of its
early proponents, and has touched areas of society that would have been impossible to
imagine when the concepts were being developed. 
Nothing that follows here diminishes that success.</p><p>However, as they become more popular, OSS/CC licenses are starting to be stretched beyond their
originally intended scope.  That
stretching could ultimately lead to large tears in the licenses and the
communities that have grown up around them. 
</p><p>These tears appear because as the use of OSS/CC licenses
expands, they are being applied to works that technically, legally, they were never designed to be used with.  In many of those cases, the licenses stop being legally enforceable at all. This lack of enforceability
may eventually reduce user confidence in OSS/CC and the vibrancy of the OSS/CC
community. <br/></p><p>To be fair, the problem described in this post falls squarely
into the “good problems to have” category. 
After all, the tears only exist because OSS/CC has become so wildly
successful that the ethos they embody is spreading well beyond their originally
envisioned scope.  <br/></p><p>That being said, the tears are real.  At some point soon the “open” community (broadly
defined) will have to come to terms with them.

sharing ethos of OSS/CC expands beyond the scope of what is actually protected
by copyright.  Without copyright, the
conditions baked into OSS/CC become legally meaningless.  The “stick” that backs them up
disappears.  </p><p>While I wish I had answers, this post is not intended to
resolve all of the questions raised by OSS/CC spilling beyond their original
boundaries. Instead, it is designed to help raise and frame the questions.  It tries to explain what is going on, and to
outline the potential consequences of the continued informal drift in the
current direction.  It also touches on
some alternative approaches, none of which are perfect.  While this post does not include a tidy
resolution, hopefully it is a useful step in the collective process of working everything
out.</p><p><b>Sharing “Born Closed” Works</b></p><p>Broadly speaking – and this entire post is going to be
“broadly speaking” – OSS/CC were created to solve a specific problem created by
copyright law.  Copyright law
automatically protects everything that is categorically eligible for
protection.  That means that things that
are protected by copyright – software for OSS; music, movies, photos, and
articles for CC – are “born closed.”  </p><p>By default, digitally sharing born closed works created by
someone else violates copyright law. 
That is because sharing works digitally involves making copies.  Making copies of a work protected by
copyright (in most cases) requires permission from the original creator in order to
avoid infringing on the creator’s copyright.

want to share it with the world, you need to take affirmative steps to give
other people permission to use the work. 
The easiest way to do this is with a license.  “I won’t sue you for sharing this” licenses
make up the legal core of OSS/CC.</p><p><b>(With Strings Attached)</b></p><p>Of course, most OSS/CC licenses are not simply promises not
to sue people who share the content.  Many
of them pair their promise not to sue with a condition.  That condition is something that the open
community views as a social good – “<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank">give the creator
attribution</a>,” “<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0" target="_blank">make the
source code freely available</a>,”  “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware" target="_blank">buy the creator a beer</a>” – but
that condition still serves as a limitation on sharing.  </p><p>Within the world of copyrightable stuff, these limitations
are enforceable because failing to follow them voids the license.  And without a license, the now-unauthorized sharing is a
violation of the creator’s copyright. 
Among other things, this has allowed to OSS/CC community to impose its
ethos on people who do not care about openness. 
Threat of a copyright lawsuit means people and companies who just want
to access the shared stuff have to play by the openness rules too.</p><p>The upshot of this situation is that OSS/CC trained a lot of
people to share, but to share conditionally. 
This conditionality was (and is) important to creating a commons: it
gives people confidence in sharing and makes them feel like they are entering a
community with reciprocity.  Conditional
sharing has created an unbelievable rich commons of code, art, and expression.</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="683" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/images/2016-09-08-the-cost-of-a-successful-creative-commons-and-open.html3.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="683"/></figure><p><i>When they are used for works protected by copyright, OSS/CC licenses are more than polite requests - they are legally enforceable. </i></p><p><br/></p><p>This entire system works because it just so happened that
the types of things that were relatively easy to create and share with a
computer and an internet connection – code, photographs, songs, movies, blog
posts – also happened to be the types of things that are automatically protected
by copyright.  That made the entire
framework more than just a cultural norm relevant to a community of people – it
was legally enforceable.</p><p>As they built the commons, people internalized the “share
with conditions” model as normal.  They
did not necessarily appreciate that the conditions were all linked to
copyright, or that copyright has limits as to what it can protect.  In part, they did not realize this because
the limitations were not relevant – everything at the core of the commons was
protected by copyright so copyright’s boundary did not matter.</p><p><b>Shift and Expansion into “Born Open”</b></p><p>That is no longer the case. 
A number of technical and cultural changes have begun to bring works
outside of the scope of copyright into the commons discussion.  This is a testament to the success of OSS/CC
– the commons are so rich and the norms so appealing that new communities
naturally align themselves with it.</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="683" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/images/2016-09-08-the-cost-of-a-successful-creative-commons-and-open.html4.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="683"/></figure><p><i>The OSS/CC party is getting bigger.</i> <i>image: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mikeywally/6068454399/in/photolist-affq58-9W1rqM-cNhsDj-8enSid-6Cj1c6-dpnL8p-khioux-gZz2yt-x1rBd-8GbVvy-53eTRM-dtLJmG-cvB54u-ieZKaV-dsAkDP-cxMSLq-o27NwE-7F3Hw1-9p1XzW-cxNaSC-4n25fT-58GrAN-auKTkV-bsySe1-kmTXfv-4CCfd9-9R17Eo-8hSijd-adbR2J-dofpAq-ebNYMA-edZq18-drH297-g1r3A6-8BLzoU-5znMNY-7NLuAg-5Vk1Wc-cxMUHq-9D34fN-9VRhQf-5whPGU-9pTFmP-aoYnK-eej5TM-8EngbJ-3LtfcS-eepPt7-7bLf2J-4Sba62" target="_blank">flickr user  Mikey Wally CC-BY-NC-ND 2.0</a></i></p><p><br/></p><p>Instead of being organized around “born closed” works
protected by copyright, some of these communities are organized around “born
open” works that are categorically outside of the scope of copyright.  The two highest profile (or at least the two I’m most familiar with) are the open source
hardware community and the 3D printing design community.  </p><p>Neither of these communities are fully outside of the scope
of copyright.  Some parts of any given
open source hardware project may be protectable by copyright, and many 3D
printed objects are protected by copyright. 
However, the functional parts of an open source hardware project and more
utilitarian 3D printed objects are beyond the scope of copyright protection
(you can just accept that distinction for the purposes of this article, but
there is more information on it <a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/documents/3-steps-for-licensing-your-3d-printed-stuff" target="_blank">here</a>
and <a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/open-source-hardware-and-law" target="_blank">here</a>).  That means that blanket assumptions about
copyright protection, and licenses that are built on a foundation of copyright
protection, do not apply as cleanly to born open objects (more about that <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2016-06-02-the-missing-half-of-open-source-hardware-licenses.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>As a result, on some level and in a non-trivial number of
cases, using copyright-based licenses for works in these communities is
inappropriate.  While they may look the
same as the licenses on software or photographs, in a significant number of
cases they will not be legally enforceable. 
At the same time, they are there for both creators and users to see, and
to take into account.  They also may carry cultural weight.  That being said, the space between
the licenses’ visibility and enforceability creates costs (and benefits).  </p><p><b>The Costs and
Benefits of the Current Path</b></p><p>To be clear, this evolution is happening right now and is actively
altering the status quo around copyright and licensing.  That means that ignoring this evolution and
pretending it isn’t happening is a vote for this shift to keep happening.  Doing something may be a vote for a different
kind of shift.  But, as far as I can
tell, there is no vote you can cast to maintain the status quo.  The only decision is between which different future you prefer to work towards.</p><p>A number of things that I would classify as negative happen
if people continue to apply copyright-based licenses to works that are not
protected by copyright:</p><ul><li><i>Creators’ expectations are not met</i>.  If a creator releases a work under an OSS/CC
license, on some level they expect to be able to enforce the terms of that
license against someone who violates it. 
However, if the work is not protected by copyright the terms of the
license are not enforceable.  As a
result, there is likely to be a high profile instance of an OSS/CC license
“failing” to protect a work from being used in a way that violates the original
creator’s hopes.  The story will appear
to have a “good” creator with a sympathetic story and a “bad” violator who acts
in a villainous, obnoxious way.  However,
the good creator will be trying to enforce rights they do not have and the bad
violator will not have broken any legal rules. 
Everyone will be sad that the bad violator can’t be punished and people will
start to worry about using OSS/CC licenses.</li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li><i>Legitimate usage is curtailed</i>.  The conditions in any OSS/CC license are
restrictions on use, and those restrictions disqualify some people from making
use of the work.  If the license used is
not valid, the restrictions it attempts to impose on unwilling users are not legally
enforceable.  Regardless, there will be
some number of end users who 1) want to use the work in a way that violates the
terms of the license, and 2) do not realize that the license does not legally
prevent them from using the work anyway.  That means that some legally allowed uses never happen.<br/></li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li><i>Copyright creeps outward</i>.  There is a deep irony in this one.  Regardless of their real enforceability, if
people continue to use and see OSS/CC licenses 
on works that are not eligible for copyright protection they will begin
to assume that copyright actually protects those works.  They might even advocate for copyright to protect the works in order to make the licenses enforceable.  The outcome of this is that OSS/CC licenses –
licenses designed to increase the pool of commonly available works – could
act to reduce the pool of commonly available works by dragging currently open works into the world of
copyright.  This process could take the
form of resetting social expectations or, perhaps even more problematically from
the viewpoint of the OSS/CC community, actually be used to change the statutory
scope of copyright itself in an effort to make the licenses apply to more works.<br/></li></ul><p>There is also a potentially positive effect of this type of
license use:</p><ul><li><i>Signals for use</i>.  The wishes of creators can be legitimate even
if they are not legally enforceable.  To
that end, OSS/CC licenses can be signals to users about how creators of a work
want it to be used.  There are plenty of
non-legal reasons for a user to want to respect these wishes, and using
standardized ways to communicate those wishes can make it easier to do so.  <br/></li></ul><p>And one that could be argued either way: </p><ul><li><i>May encourage more sharing</i>.  For some creators who are not naturally
inclined towards sharing, using an OSS/CC license gives them enough of an
assurance of control to convince them to make their works available to others.  You can see this on how some people evolve from more-restrictive to less-restrictive licenses over time as they become more comfortable with the idea of sharing.  The positive version of the use of these
licenses on non-copyrightable work is that more formerly private works will be
released into the public for others to see. 
The negative version is that the creators will be mistaken with regards
to the terms those works are released under. 
I withhold judgment on how those two factors balance out.<br/></li></ul><p>There are some ways to address these effects.  None of them are perfect, or even necessarily
good ideas.  </p><ul><li><i>Expand copyright or create a new
easy-to-obtain right</i>.  The problem
described here is rooted in the fact that many works are not automatically
protected by copyright or some other easy-to-obtain right which can be used as the legal basis for a license.  One way to solve it is to expand the scope of
copyright or create a new easy-to-obtain right that serves a similar purpose. 
While doing so would solve the immediate issue with license enforceability, it creates many more and is a
horrible idea.  Converting the universe
of “born open” works into “born closed” just to make it easier to openly
license them strikes me as counterproductive. 
Also, while some of the creators of these newly born closed works might
license them openly, others would likely use the new rights to restrict what
today would be a free and open creation.<i><br/></i></li></ul><ul><li><i>Public Education.</i>  I want to think that this alone can solve the
problem. If people really understand when to appropriately use copyright-based
licenses, this problem disappears.  While
I believe strongly that public education is a key component of addressing this
problem, I’m also realistic enough to know that there will always be a massive
pool of people who have better things to fill their brains with than the
nuances of copyrightable subject matter. 
Any solution has to work for those people too.  That means we need more than public education.<br/></li></ul><ul><li><i>Create New Licenses</i>.  If copyright-based licenses don’t quite cut
it, why not draft new licenses that do? Because – like creating secure
encryption that also allows the government to freely access the protected files
– doing so is a lot easier said than done. 
Copyright is a great basis for a license because eligible works are
protected automatically and without cost. 
People do not have to do anything to get copyright protection.  All of the other obvious hooks for other
licenses – like patent and trademark – require time, money, and affirmative
decisions to obtain.  Even if some people
will take the time to obtain them just to make it easier to license their work under OSS/CC, those people will never reach a critical mass or majority.<br/></li></ul><ul><li><i>Stop Using Licenses</i>.  If current licenses do not protect all of
these new types of works, should people just stop using them? Unfortunately,
that’s not a great solution either. 
While many works will not be completely protected by copyright, many
parts of many works are.  The analysis of
which parts of which works are protected by copyright is somewhat work-specific
(because nothing here is easy), but it is safe to assume that many works will
be just protected enough by copyright that copyright could present a barrier to
some types of reuses.  To the extent they
exist for a given work, OSS/CC licenses can clear those copyright-based barriers to sharing.<br/></li></ul><ul><li><i>Contracts</i>.  Contracts can serve as an alternative to
licenses.  While OSS/CC licenses rely on
copyright to be enforceable, contracts can just rely on the agreement of two
people.  The creator offers the work to a
user on the condition that the user agrees to the terms. If the user breaks the terms she has
agreed to, she is breaking the contract with the creator.  The problem with contracts is that they can
only be enforced against someone who agreed to them.  That is always going to be a comparatively small universe of people.  Whether they like it or not, everyone is
required by law to respect a copyright. That means
that the person who receives the work directly from the creator may be limited
by the terms of a contract, but the people who stumble upon it on a random
website would not be.  This global
enforceability is what makes copyright law so attractive for licenses. Its
absence severely limits the usefulness of contracts as a substitute at scale.<br/></li></ul><p><b>Decision Time</b></p><p>The status quo is changing. 
OSS/CC licenses are expanding beyond the universe of clearly
copyright-protected works that they were originally designed for.  That is a testament to 30+ years of community
building in the open community.  It also
creates challenges.  Ideally this is the
point in the post where I would describe a clear path forward and advocate for
following it.  Unfortunately, I don’t
have that path (yet).  All I have is a phenomenon that
I believe is occurring and a series of ways the world is accommodating it.  </p><p>Fortunately, the open world is strong because it is
collaborative.  I’m already working with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2016/07/15/meeting-debrief-next-steps-challenge-attribution-view-source-3d-printing/" target="_blank">Creative Commons and other stakeholders</a> to try and find some answers.  Hopefully this post will pique the interest of others to join in.  If it has (and let’s be honest - if you made it all the way down here it probably has) <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/about" target="_blank">let me know</a>.  </p><p><br/></p><p><i>Bonus: One thing that is connected enough to mention in a bonus but not so connected as to be worth integrating into the heart of the post is the history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License" target="_blank">Open Game License</a>.  For all of its differences, it is another example of communities looking to licenses for openness where they probably didn’t quite fit and were not necessary.  I won’t pretend to be an expert on the details of that community or the politics connected to all of it, but <a href="http://gamerviceroy.blogspot.com/2012/12/legal-issues-in-gaming-open-game-license.html" target="_blank">this article</a> on it made a lot of sense.</i></p><p><br/></p><p><i>top image: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicknormal/26077864591/in/photolist-FJpSB2-4vmor9-9D8RAF-HNXR9F-FQgTKZ-5bSUo2-6KCwoQ-9VjqVY-HWaZuH-dZ1ojE-7pL4FR-JKCpSV-7xGAx8-dZ1aQu-dZ1aHm-8KF3yE-btBS6C-dZ1odq-ujmYZP-dYUG1V-JPuE7J-JHnPu7-ksrQhX-5AByeQ-6DvVuR-JPu39S-JrGh6w-HW7t8M-pbDAib-boLyAR-9C7ADt-5cQJcB-a5FMNo-cc9ttW-dZ1cF3-JHn3hd-kwB5E-9rjjG4-493ziN-JjWkdh-eZHN1X-7eiDqB-bqsp3-4KUsmt-8Lwtqe-b2RPxP-b7MFRn-9ead6r-fyTVBK-9r5HDb" target="_blank">flickr user Nick Normal CC-BY-NC-ND 2.0</a>.</i><br/></p>
