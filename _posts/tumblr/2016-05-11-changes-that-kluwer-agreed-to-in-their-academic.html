<p>Occasionally I find myself in the highly fortunate position to be asked to contribute to a scholarly journal without having any professional incentive to do so.  This is exciting because I’m as flattered as anyone when someone else is interested enough in my writing to want to republish it.  It also gives me a chance to come into contact with the kinds of contracts that academic publishers offer their contributors.  To put it mildly, these contracts are insane.  In exchange for an unpaid contribution, the contracts expect the authors to give the publishers all sorts of exclusive rights and to indemnify the authors against any sort of infringement lawsuit.</p><p>Fortunately for me, and unlike so many people who are confronted with these types of contracts, I have no professional incentive to publish in academic journals.  That makes me free to push back against the contract terms.  The worst thing that happens is that the publisher decides I’m more trouble than I’m worth - it isn’t going to knock me off tenure track or anything.</p><p>As what I hope is a service to others who are confronted with these contracts without the ability to walk away, I wanted to publish the version of the contract that the publisher (Kluwer in this case) agreed to pretty easily.  I obviously can’t guarantee that they would make the same concessions again (although it really didn’t take much to get to this point). At a minimum, it might give you the ability to push back when you hear that these terms “cannot be changed.”</p><p>All of the struck terms were in the original but are not in the signed contract.  I XXXX’d out the terms of the work because it isn’t really my place to announce the work in advance.  </p><p><br/></p><blockquote><p>The undersigned (hereafter called the
Author) and Kluwer Law International, XXXXXXX, The Netherlands, (hereinafter called the Publisher)</p><p>whereas the Publisher wishes to publish
the Work entitled &ldquo;XXXX &rdquo; under the
editorship of YYYYYYYYY (hereinafter
called the Editor)<br/></p><p>whereas the Author has declared his
willingness to write the contribution provisionally entitled       (hereinafter
called the Contribution) declare that they have agreed as follows: </p><p>1.   The Author agrees to write the
above mentioned contribution as agreed with the Editor and/or the Publisher.</p><p>2.   The Author hereby grants to
the Publisher the <strike>exclusive</strike> right to publish, sell, give access to and license the use of
the Contribution named above in all countries and all languages, in whole or in
part, including any translation, abridgement, substantial part, modification or
revision thereof, in book form, in a database on its own or with other works
and in any form, including, without limitation, mechanical, aural, electronic
and visual reproduction and publication, electronic storage and retrieval
systems, including delivery of or giving access to the Work by electronic
networks, and all other forms of electronic or electro-magnetic publication now
known or hereinafter invented, throughout the world, for the full period of the
respective intellectual property rights (including copyright) and all renewals
and extensions thereof. 
















<strike>The Author hereby authorises and mandates the
Publisher to register (at the Publisher&rsquo;s cost) this licence in any applicable
register for intellectual property rights and to take any action and instigate
proceedings against infringement of copyright or other intellectual property
rights in the Contribution and to use the Author’s name as a party after
informing the Author. The Author is hereby licensed by the Publisher to the
rights reserved as specified at the end of this agreement. 



</strike></p><p>3.   The Author warrants and
represents that to the best of his knowledge the Contribution does not infringe
upon any copyright or other right(s), and that it does not contain infringing,
libellous, obscene or other unlawful matter, that he is the sole and exclusive
owner of the rights herein conveyed to the Publisher, and that he has obtained
the necessary permission from the copyright owner or his legal representative
whenever a passage from copyrighted material is quoted or a table or
illustration from such material is used. 
















<strike>The Author will indemnify the Publisher for, and
hold the Publisher harmless from, any loss, expense or damage occasioned by any
claim or suit by a third party for copyright infringement or arising out of any
breach of the foregoing warranties as a result of publication of the
Contribution.</strike> 



The Contribution shall be delivered to
the Publisher free of copyright charges.</p><p>4.   The Author warrants and
represents that the Contribution to the Work has not been previously published
elsewhere, or that if it has been published in whole or in part, any permission
necessary to publish it in the Work has been obtained and provided to the
Publisher together with a statement of the original copyright notice.</p><p>5.   The Author agrees to be named
as author of his Contribution. The Author declares and warrants that any person
named as co-author of the Contribution is aware of that fact and has agreed to
being so named. The Author signs this agreement also on behalf of and in the
name of each co-author, who hereby agree with this agreement in full, in
particular Clause 3 and 8. The Author warrants and represents that he is
empowered by any co-author to represent this co-author in signing this
agreement in their name. </p><p>6.   The Author shall receive for
the rights granted in Art. 2 a free copy of the (updated) Work plus an
electronic file of his (updated) contribution. 
















<strike>The Author warrants and represents that any
personal use of the contribution by the Author will be limited to the use
permitted by the rights reserved to the Author as specified at the end of this
agreement.</strike> 



The Publisher shall clearly
state the name of the Author in the Work.</p><p>7.   The present agreement also
applies to future updates to the Contribution by the Author. The Author agrees
that the Publisher may request to have a third party take over the writing and
updating of the Contribution. <strike> The Author will comply with said request and will cooperate with the new
contributor for transfer of his responsibilities with respect to the
Contribution. The Author agrees that if the revision has not substantially been
prepared by the Author, the Publisher is not required to mention the name of
the Author in or in relation to the Work. With respect to such revision the
Author waives his moral rights to the extent allowed by law. </strike></p><p>8.   The
present agreement can be terminated by the Publisher without prior notice if
the Author fails to deliver the Contribution according to the agreed deadline.
Termination shall not affect the rights and obligations accrued prior to
termination. Any provisions of this agreement which by their nature extend
beyond termination shall survive such termination.</p><p>9.   This agreement is governed by
Dutch law. Any dispute that may arise shall be brought before the applicable
court in Amsterdam in The Netherlands.</p><p>/s/ <br/></p><p><b><strike>RIGHTS
