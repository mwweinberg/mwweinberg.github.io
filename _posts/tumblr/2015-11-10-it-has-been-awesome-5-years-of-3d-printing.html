our first 3D printing whitepaper called “<a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/it-will-be-awesome-if-they-dont-screw-it-up-3d-printing" target="_blank">It
Will Be Awesome if They Don’t Screw it Up: 3D Printing, Intellectual Property,
and the Fight Over the Next Great Disruptive Technology</a>.”  It was our attempt to take Public Knowledge’s
expertise in intellectual property and apply it to the then-emerging world of
3D printing.  <a href="http://alexcurtis.info/" target="_blank">Alex Curtis</a> had been pushing Public
Knowledge to look into 3D printing for a while, and Simon Bradshaw, Adrian Bowyer,
and Patrick Haufe, released <a href="http://www2.law.ed.ac.uk/ahrc/script-ed/vol7-1/bradshaw.asp" target="_blank">their paper</a>
on 3D printing and IP earlier that year. 
Thanks to a jury duty-enforced light work load for the summer of 2010, I
got to beat Alex to the punch and write the PK paper essentially porting the EU
and UK legal analysis from the Bradshaw/Bowyer/Haufe paper to US law.</p><p>At the time neither Public Knowledge institutionally nor I
personally knew a lot of people in the 3D printing world directly.  In an attempt to help the paper find an
audience, as part of the whitepaper rollout I did a series of 6 brief
interviews with people in the community who were nice enough to respond to my
emails.  To celebrate the five year
anniversary of the paper, I’m going to repost these interviews today.</p><p>Taken as a collection, the interviews capture a moment in 3D
printing history before it really hit the mainstream.  It was moving there – 3D printing had been
featured in the New York Times – but talking to anyone about 3D printing still
required a level of filling-in-of-background before you could get to whatever
you really wanted to discuss.  These
short discussions were mostly aimed at getting answers to a handful of
questions: what are people doing today with 3D printing?  What will it look like in 2, 3, or even 5
years? What does the market look like and how it is changing?</p><p>Re-listening to these interviews, it is disorienting – and more
than a little bit humbling - to hear myself asking people the same types of
questions that people ask me today.  They
serve as a good reminder that, no matter when it happens, many people work
through a similar sequence of questions when they come into contact with 3D
printing for the first time.</p><p>I think it is fair to say that this paper kicked off an
interesting five years for me.  Two more
papers, countless blog posts, speaking opportunities, a quartet of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LsqKTqz3Dg" target="_blank">3D/DC</a>s (one year we did
an Open Source Hardware event instead), and ultimately a new job followed.  That made it fun for me to listen to these
again.  Maybe they will be interesting to
someone else as well.  They don’t have
any intro or outro music, so apologies in advance for how abruptly the start
and stop. </p><p><a href="http://adrianbowyer.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Adrian Bowyer</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="unknown" data-orig-width="100" data-orig-height="60" data-url=""><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232439107&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></figure><p>While I like each of these interviews, this is probably my
favorite.  Professor Bowyer explains the
origins of the RepRap with biological metaphors that stick with me to this
day.  His framing of the goals of the
RepRap project will make even the most cynical 3D printing veteran stop and
reflect on its success.  On a more
practical level, I remember recording the entire interview under the threat of
a firewood delivery interrupting his side of the interview.  Fortunately we wrapped up before the wood
arrived.<br/></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/distractedarchi" target="_blank">Michael Curry</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="unknown" data-orig-width="100" data-orig-height="60" data-url=""><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232439109&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></figure><p>Michael recorded this interview from the stairwell of his
offices at an architectural design firm in Kansas City.  Shortly after this interview he moved to
Brooklyn to work at Makerbot designing some truly amazing things.  He’s now back in Kansas City working for
Formlabs.  Probably the most interesting
part of this conversation is when he talks about the importance of design in
expanding the scope of 3D printing and bringing in new designers and users.</p><p><a href="http://www.brepettis.com/" target="_blank">Bre Pettis</a><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="unknown" data-orig-width="100" data-orig-height="60" data-url=""><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232439108&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></figure></p><p>Continuing the theme of awkward recording conditions, I’m
pretty sure Bre recorded this entire interview standing in the middle of Union
Square Park in Manhattan between meetings. 
What strikes me listening to this 5 years later is how comfortable being
interviewed and enthusiastic about 3D printing he is.  Listening to it, it is easy to believe how
quickly Makerbot grew in the following years.

community and was able to explain how the community came together and evolved.  He, along with Rick Pollack, probably does
the best job of capturing the mindset of that RepRap community at the end of
2010.  For Andrew, it is from the
perspective of those community members who saw themselves as pushing the limits
of what the printers could do.</p><p><a href="http://www.makergear.com/" target="_blank">Rick Pollack</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="unknown" data-orig-width="100" data-orig-height="60" data-url=""><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232439112&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></figure><p>Then, as now, Rick is in charge of the desktop 3D printer
company Makergear.  If Andrew was on the
user side of the RepRap community spectrum, Rick was on the vanguard of RepRap
community members who were actively working to build a business in 3D
printing.  In his explanation of how he
sees the role of Makergear, you can hear the founders of countless other entrepreneurs
who have managed to bring 3D printing businesses to market.</p><p><a href="http://www.schouwenburg.com/" target="_blank">Robert Schouwenburg</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="unknown" data-orig-width="100" data-orig-height="60" data-url=""><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232439113&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></figure><p>It is striking how familiar Robert’s description of
Shapeways feels today.  We’re still
working hard to be a place for designers and shopowners, and still pushing to
make more materials available to more people. 
I’d like to think that Shapeways has taken big steps towards fulfilling
the potential that he describes, while still being focused on improving what we
offer all of our users.</p><p>Michael Weinberg</p><figure class="tmblr-full tmblr-embed" data-provider="unknown" data-orig-width="100" data-orig-height="60" data-url=""><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/232439115&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></figure><p>In pulling these together I found a description that I gave
to the interview subjects about what Public Knowledge was doing in 3D printing
and what these interviews are all about. 
It was accurate then and it still feels accurate today.</p>
