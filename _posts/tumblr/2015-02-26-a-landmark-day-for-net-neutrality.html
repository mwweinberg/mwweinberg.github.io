<p>After an unprecedented outpouring of public support, today the FCC 
voted to enact the strongest net neutrality rules in history.  By 
embracing its Title II authority and creating clear, bright line rules 
against blocking and discrimination, Chairman Wheeler and the FCC have 
earned a reputation as defenders of an Open Internet.</p>

<p>This day would not have happened without the support of the millions 
of Americans who commented with the FCC, called Congress, and wrote to 
the White House.  This bipartisan wave of Open Internet supporters from 
across the country came together to make it clear to their government 
that it had a crucial role in protecting an Open Internet.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://whatisnetneutrality.org/timeline" target="_blank">months and years</a>
 of hard work and advocacy, today is a day to celebrate and savor.  
Public Knowledge will provide more a detailed analysis of the rules and 
the order soon, but for now take a moment to reflect upon and enjoy the 
win.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, <strong>the best way to enjoy a win is with a party</strong>. 
 If you are in DC tonight, please join us at the Victory for the Net 
party, co-hosted with our allies at Free Press, ColorOfChange.org, 
Common Cause, CREDO Action, Daily Kos, Demand Progress, the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation, Fight for the Future, the Internet Archive, the 
Media Action Grassroots Network, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, 
the Open Technology Institute, and the Progressive Change Campaign 
Committee.</p>
