First, although the letter first broadly references a generic “intellectual property depicted or embodied in connection with the shark images and costumes,” later on it references a
 specific section of copyright law. In light of that, let’s assume that 
Katy Perry (and although the letter comes from Katy Perry’s lawyers, 
they are her representatives so I’m just going to refer to them 
collectively as Katy Perry because it is more fun) is claiming to have a
 copyright in the shark costume.</p><p>The problem with this is that courts have generally found that 
copyright does not protect costumes (even fairly creative ones). 
Essentially, courts have lumped costumes in with other kinds of clothing
 and considered them all the kind of “useful article” that is beyond the
 scope of copyright protection. If you are curious, that use in this 
articles is things like “preventing you from being naked” and “keeping 
you warm.”</p><p>There are some legal theories that could be put forward to try and 
get copyright protection for a specific costume, but they mostly come 
into play when there are elements of a costume that could exist 
independently of the costume or when the costume is tied to a character 
developed in a book, movie, or play. It would probably be a stretch to 
put Left Shark into either of these categories.</p><p>An addition note is that even if the Left Shark costume is protected 
by copyright, that doesn’t automatically make Katy Perry the owner of 
that copyright. But let’s set that aside for now.</p><p><b>Quick Background (DMCA)</b></p><p>The second thing to keep in mind (and I promise I’ll bring all of 
this home) has to do with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or the 
DMCA for short. There are a number of parts of the DMCA (<a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/tell-the-copyright-office-to-remove-these-digital-locks" target="_blank">click here</a>
 to learn about the part that might prevent you from using your own 
filament in a 3D printer, ripping your own DVD, or accessing data from 
medical devices implanted in your chest), but one of them protects 
websites that host content for people – websites like Shapeways, 
YouTube, and Facebook – from copyright liability.</p><p>Websites get this protection as long as they comply with a specific 
set of requirements, and are under no obligation to take down infringing
 content as long as they are in compliance. One of these requirements is
 to takedown copyrighted content if they get a request from the 
copyright holder – this request is sometimes called a DMCA takedown 
request. However, that request includes a requirement that the person 
sending it affirm under penalty of perjury that they are the owner of 
the copyright (or their designated agent).</p><p><b>Background Over – Let’s Get On With It</b></p><p>With those two things in mind, let’s look at Katy Perry’s letter. The
 most important thing about the letter is probably what it is not – the 
letter is not a real DMCA takedown notice. For one thing, it is missing a
 link to the actual allegedly infringing work. Perhaps more importantly,
 it is missing a statement – remember this statement has to be made 
under penalty of perjury – that the person sending the notice actually 
owns a copyright in the work being discussed.</p><p>Instead, the letter is presented as a “cease and desist” letter, a 
kind of letter sometimes described by lawyers as a “nastygram.” In some –
 although not all – cases nastygrams are designed to intimidate the 
recipient into compliance (often through the use of fancy letterhead and
 scary language) even if the sender does not actually have the legal 
power to back up the threats.</p><p>It is hard to tell if this letter falls into that category, but there
 are some interesting clues. First, there is the question of the costume
 copyrightability at all. It is not clear that anyone owns a copyright 
in Left Shark. And if no one owns a copyright in Left Shark, no one can 
demand that a Left Shark model get taken down from Shapeways. Second, 
there is the question of who would own the copyright in Left Shark if it
 were to exist. It is certainly possible that Katy Perry was farsighed 
enough to demand ownership of the copyrights of every costume in the 
halftime show, but it isn’t automatic.</p><p>And third is the choice of a nastygram over a real DMCA takedown 
notice. Katy Perry has fancy lawyers. They know that a website like 
Shapeways is immune from copyright liability unless they receive a 
properly formatted DMCA notice. But they also know that a property 
formatted DMCA notice would require an oath that Katy Perry actually 
owned an existent copyright in Left Shark. If they were worried about 
the truth of either of those things, they might have hoped that a 
nastygram would give them the outcome they were looking for without 
exposing them to perjury liability.</p><p>Or maybe they just prefer sending nastygrams to DMCA notices. 
Hopefully Katy Perry will explain what part of Left Shark she owns so we
 can clear all of this up. Until then, color me a skeptic.</p><p>*I admit that I’m not familiar enough with the Katy Perry catalog to 
artfully weave Katy Perry puns and references into this blog post. You 
are well within your rights as a reader to expect them, and I’m sorry to
 disappoint you. <br/></p><p><i>Left Shark image from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:667127" target="_blank">thingiverse user mstyle183</a></i>.</p><p><i>This post originally <a href="http://makezine.com/2015/02/06/why-katy-perrys-lawyers-just-jumped-the-shark/" target="_blank">ran on the Make blog</a> under the headline</i> Why Katy Perry&rsquo;s Lawyers Just Jumped the Shark.  <i>That&rsquo;s a perfectly good headline.  In fact, many people (and at least one person very close to me) think that headline is better than the one here.  And they may be right.  But this is my blog and I&rsquo;m sticking with &ldquo;fishy,&rdquo; obnoxious scare quotes and all.</i><br/></p>
