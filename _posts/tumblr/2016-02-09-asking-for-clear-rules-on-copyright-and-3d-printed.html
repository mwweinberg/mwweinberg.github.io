<p><i>This post <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/23650-asking-for-clear-rules-on-copyright-and-3d-printed-objects.html" target="_blank">originally appeared</a> on the Shapeways blog.</i></p><p><br/></p><p>Yesterday Shapeways joined with <a href="http://formlabs.com/" target="_blank">Formlabs</a> and <a href="https://matterandform.net/" target="_blank">Matter and Form</a>
 to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to bring some clarity to the rules that 
govern copyright and 3D printed objects (among many other things).  In a
 <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Star-Athletica-v-Varsity-Brands-Amicus-of-Shapeways-FILED.pdf" target="_blank">brief</a> prepared by Sydney Lakin and Bill Koch at Stanford Law School’s <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/juelsgaard-intellectual-property-and-innovation-clinic/" target="_blank">Juelsgaard IP and Innovation Clinic</a>,
 we urged the Court to settle on a single test for determining which 
parts of some 3D printed models can be protected by copyright.</p><p>The case is the same one I <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/21948-q-what-brings-cheerleaders-and-3d-printing-together.html" target="_blank">blogged about last year</a>
 regarding cheerleader uniforms.  The real issue at stake – which is 
larger than either cheerleader uniforms or 3D printing – is how 
copyright law should handle objects that mix copyrightable and 
non-copyrightable elements.</p><p>Briefly, purely decorative and non-functional objects (like StuffBySteve’s <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/product/J7YMJKGSA/snowflake-ornament?li=nav&amp;optionId=40970327" target="_blank">snowflake ornament</a>) are eligible for copyright protection.  Purely functional objects (like leegreen’s <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/product/2LNURQMEM/no-50-tripod-clip?li=nav&amp;optionId=56324809" target="_blank">No. 50 Tripod Clip</a>) are not eligible for copyright protection.</p><p>The question arises when a 3D printed object incorporates both decorative and functional elements (like Gijs’ <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/product/SDJE8FSXV/birdsnest-eggcup-quattro?li=nav&amp;optionId=1411744" target="_blank">birdsnest eggcup</a> above).
 If you extend copyright to the entire thing, you are using copyright to
 protect functional objects (that’s bad).  If you exclude it from 
copyright entirely, you are taking protection away from decorative 
elements that may be eligible for it (also bad).</p><p>The theoretical way to deal with this conflict is to try and separate
 out the functional and non-functional elements and only grant copyright
 protection to the non-functional ones.  In practice, we currently have 
10 different tests to govern the separating.  As you might expect, these
 10 different tests floating around make it hard to know exactly what is
 protected by copyright and what is not.</p><p>Fortunately, this sort of “too many conflicting tests trying to 
answer a legal question” is exactly the type of situation where the 
Supreme Court is designed to shine.  This case gives them the 
opportunity to settle on a single, nationwide test for how to think 
about mixed functional and non-functional objects.</p><p>That’s precisely what we are asking them to do with this brief.  At 
this stage, we are not even advocating for one test over the other. 
While some tests are better than others, we feel that the most important
 thing is to have a single test that everyone can rely on.</p><p>What happens next?  This is the stage in the process where parties 
are asking the Supreme Court to take a look at their case.  Many more 
cases ask for review than are ever reviewed, and the Supreme Court is 
mostly free to pick and choose to hear whichever cases it wants to.  If 
the Supreme Court decides to hear the case there will be an opportunity 
to weigh on the substantive questions presented by it (as opposed to 
just weighing in that the Supreme Court should take the case).  That is 
followed by oral argument and, eventually, a decision.</p><p>That’s obviously a lot of steps between now and a final resolution. 
Regardless of what happens, we’ll keep you up to date.  If you have any 
questions, don’t be shy about jumping into the comments.</p>
