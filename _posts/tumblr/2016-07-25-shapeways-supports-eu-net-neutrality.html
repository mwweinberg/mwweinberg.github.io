<p><i>This post originally appeared on the <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/26310-shapeways-supports-eu-net-neutrality.html" target="_blank">Shapeways blog</a>.</i></p><p>Shapeways has long been a supporter of Net Neutrality, so we were happy to be able to join a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldr-_93Jdry_FYa40QmXqjQY1BJzjXhEe601TYNLL9o/edit?pref=2&amp;pli=1" target="_blank">letter</a> from the European startup community in favor of strong open internet rules in the EU.</p><p>Shapeways started in the Netherlands and has continuously relied on a neutral Internet to reach our customers. To the same extent, the Shapeways community uses the open internet to connect with other members and customers around the world.</p><p>Fundamentally, our letter asks the EU not to weaken net neutrality rules with loopholes.  Regardless of whether they are called  ”specialised services,” “data cap exceptions,” or “class-based traffic management,” loopholes that allow ISPs to pick winners and losers undermine the core ideas of net neutrality.</p><p>All of this and more is why we join the call for strong net neutrality rules in the EU.  We will be sure to let you know what happens as this process develops.</p>
