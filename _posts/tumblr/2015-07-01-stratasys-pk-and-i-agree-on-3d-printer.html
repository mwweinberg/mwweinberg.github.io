We’ll see in the next few months which gamble (if any?) pays off.</p><p><b>The Makerbot Twist</b></p><p>There has been a Makerbot subplot running through this entire proceeding, and the Stratasys response added another chapter.  Stratasys owns Makerbot and a significant amount of the discussion during the Copyright Office hearing discussed Makerbot specifically.</p><p>One of the things that <a href="http://michaelweinberg.org/2018/06/16/2015-05-28-unlocking-3d-printing-hearing.html" target="_blank">I took from the hearing</a> was that Stratasys was seriously considering adding DRM to their Makerbot line that locked Makerbots to Stratasys-approved filament. However, a week later the new Makerbot CEO (who, not incidentally, is also the son of the Chairman of Stratasys proper so presumably has deep ties inside the company) <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2015/06/19/our-meeting-with-jonathan-jaglom-the-new-ceo-of-makerbot-makerbot-jjaglom-stratasys-adafruit/" target="_blank">told Adafruit</a> that he had no plans to DRM Makerbot filament.</p><p>Obviously the timetable is a bit compressed, but Stratasys’ response to the Copyright Office could have provided them an opportunity to clarify their plans with regard to Makerbot and DRM on the record.  The fact that they didn’t take that opportunity doesn’t inherently mean that they are being duplicitous (there are a million legitimate internal logistical reasons that the statement didn’t make it into the filing).  But it certainly does seem fair to note it as a missed opportunity.  The impression that Stratasys gave the Copyright Office was that the option to add filament DRM to Makerbot printers was important to them. This could have been a good opportunity to correct that impression, and it was one they did not take.</p><p><br/></p><p><i>image credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/wcdumonts/8265151843/in/photolist-dAn4FZ-dBRbZC-HDEp6-mD47k-6m1YRM-5UEGwU-ArXG3-bnrCwz-e4raNa-dZ8QCK-ebbRP5-rs9heb-4y97oT-6bDMPi-2iJV6z-eKkBwt-pa2Kud-5rEbmK-5Z9SW8-4f62bn-bXKoKA-4FKvHs-47zT4Z-p799Aj-uW1tUG-dr8chi-7PhCa6-Arurp-tKFA-fKahdx-4ydvLE-3Hoi5z-4iDUFN-4LLjwY-d1oPyf-3inbLH-61ncFw-dRbvcN-LVibA-9sH2UN-bqK3X-oezRC-pdyhYb-a3JZ83-8PDq7q-oXyiG9-zKZdH-5Grqkf-7oV8x6-dnFb3R" target="_blank">flickr user Mark Dumont</a>.</i></p>
