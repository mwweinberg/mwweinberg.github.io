<p>Today the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is launching a<a href="http://www.innovation.va.gov/challenge/" target="_blank"> challenge initiative</a>
 to help improve prosthetics and assistive technologies.  As part of the
 Innovation Creation Series Challenge, the VA is pushing for rapid 
innovation around the development of personalized technologies to 
improve care and quality of life for Veterans.  Of course, when you hear
 personalization and innovation you know 3D printing can’t be far 
behind.</p><p>The goal of the initiative is to use 3D printing and 
distributed creation to contribute to an open ecosystem of prosthetics 
and other assistive technologies.  Think of an entire universe of<a href="http://enablingthefuture.org/" target="_blank"> e-nable</a> type devices and prosthetics for people with disabilities and  you can begin to imagine why this is a big deal.</p><p><a href="http://www.shapeways.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3D-printed-device.jpg" target="_blank"></a></p><p>The VA has rolled out a list of specific challenges to kickstart the initiative:</p><ul><li>Develop novel upper and lower extremity devices at the end of the prothesis for daily use.</li>
<li>Create a medication pill box that allows the flexibility to hold 
medications that need to be taken up to 8 times a day with a reminder 
system for each time medication needs to be taken.</li>
<li>Create a device that can dampen tremor when a Veteran is performing fine motor tasks.</li>
<li>Design a device to remotely change the speed and grip strength of a 
prosthetic device for our Veterans with upper extremity injuries.</li>
<li>Create a way to reassign motions and buttons on the Nintendo Wii 
controller to allow for alternative methods of access to games for 
Veterans with physical disabilities.</li>
</ul><p>The entire challenge is running on an accelerated timeline 
designed to turn ideas into reality as quickly as possible.  After 
launching today, collaborators and participants will work together to 
create, refine, and improve designs through May, June, and July.  The 
challenge ends with a two-day makeathon on July 28th and 29th at the 
Hunter Holmes VA Medical Center in Richmond, VA.</p><p>These types of challenges help showcase the best of 3D 
printing’s potential to make the world a better place.  If you want to
