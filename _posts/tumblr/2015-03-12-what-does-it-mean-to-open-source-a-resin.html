 that it was open sourcing one of the resins for its spark 3D printer. 
Autodesk says that they are releasing the recipe under a Creative 
Commons attribution-share alike license, and invited the community to 
remix, improve, and build upon it as they saw fit. This decision is 
commendable on the part of Autodesk, but what does it actually mean to 
open source 3D printing resin?</p>

<p>Open source can mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but 
generally speaking it usually involves (at least) two elements. The 
first is releasing documentation for the thing being open sourced in a 
way that allows people to understand how it works and really begin to 
access it. The second is licensing any intellectual property rights 
connected to the thing being open sourced in a way that allows sharing, 
remixing, and building upon.</p>

<p>Autodesk’s announcement appears to fulfill that first requirement 
quite well: they released the ingredient list of the resin. This should 
allow people outside of Autodesk to accurately reproduce the resin, 
which is the first step to building up on it.</p>

<p>The second requirement is a bit more complicated. The language in the
 announcement blog post makes it clear that Autodesk’s intention is to 
invite people to use and improve the resin as they see fit. And the use 
of the Creative Commons license is a signal about how Autodesk would 
like people to use the resin.</p>

<p>But is that license really necessary? Licenses are important in the 
context of open source software because software is automatically 
protected by copyright.  Software’s default state is protected, and the 
creator of software needs to take affirmative steps in order to allow 
other people to remix and build upon their work.</p>

<p>Resin is different. Resin, and a formula for resin, is not protected 
by copyright.  Unless Autodesk decided to patent its resin, that resin 
is “open” by default.  No one needs permission from Autodesk to copy or 
improve upon their resin, or to reproduce its core formula. In that 
sense, Autodesk’s Creative Commons license on the formula is legally 
meaningless.</p>

<p>Autodesk is a big company with a lot of lawyers, and those lawyers 
undoubtedly understand that the licenses here are largely symbolic. That
 can be ok, because even when licenses aren’t legally binding, they can 
serve as important signaling devices to users (when getting close to a 
big company with lots of lawyers, wanting a belt and suspenders rights 
clearance guarantee isn’t crazy).</p>

<p>But as the world of open source expands beyond software, it is 
important to take time to remember that translating the open source 
spirit to non-copyrightable things isn’t as simple as transferring 
existing licenses. Among many other things, that means remembering that 
the absence of a license doesn’t mean something is closed, and that the 
presence of a license doesn’t necessarily give you any permissions that 
you didn’t have already.</p>

<p>None of this takes anything away from Autodesk today. If this is what
 it means for them to “think differently about 3D printing” it should be
 welcomed and cheered. But that doesn’t make it any less important to 
pay close attention to what, exactly, they are doing.</p>
