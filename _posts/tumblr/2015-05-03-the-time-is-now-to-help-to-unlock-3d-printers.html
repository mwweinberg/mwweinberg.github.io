<p><i>This post <a href="http://makezine.com/2015/04/30/really-3d-printer/" target="_blank">originally appeared</a> on the Make: blog on April 30, 2015.</i></p><p>The Copyright Office needs to hear that people want to be able to use whatever materials they choose in their 3D printers. <a href="https://dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org/form" target="_blank">Click here to add your voice</a>.</p><p>Want to know more?</p><p>For the past few months, the Copyright Office has been holding a process designed to decide if people can do all <a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/tell-the-copyright-office-to-remove-these-digital-locks" target="_blank">sorts of legitimate things</a> like unlock cell phones, make fair uses of videos on DVD, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere" target="_blank">repair their cars and tractors</a> without violating part of copyright law in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Objections to doing those things were <a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/comments-032715/" target="_blank">released</a> earlier this month, and replies to those objections are due May 1.</p><p>One request that is part of this process is a request to prevent 
copyright law from getting in the way of people using the materials of 
their choice in their 3D printers. The request is necessary because some
 3D printer manufacturers use control technologies like verification 
chips and RFID tags to make sure that their printers can only work with 
materials that the manufacturers themselves sell. If you try and use 
“unapproved materials” in these printers — even if you own them — you 
could be sued for violating the DMCA.</p><p>The <a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/comments-032715/class%2026/STRATASYS_Class26_1201_2014.pdf" target="_blank">biggest objection</a>
 to this request came from the 3D printing company Stratasys. 
Among other things, Stratasys dismisses the idea that anyone actually 
wants to use unapproved materials in their 3D printers, or that legal 
uncertainty would reduce the chances of someone feeling comfortable 
doing so:</p><p>“The only alleged evidence of any person experiencing uncertainty 
[around using unapproved materials in a 3D printer] consists of a single
 quote from a comment on a web forum &hellip; [a]t a minimum, this comment 
is merely conclusory or anecdotal evidence that is insufficient to 
meet the substantial adverse impact standard required by the statute.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.digitalrighttorepair.org/" target="_blank">coalition fighting for a right to access and repair digital objects</a>
 needs your help to show that there is more than a single person on a 
web forum interested in using materials in 3D printers without 
permission. We need you to <a href="https://dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org/form" target="_blank">tell the Copyright Office</a> that copyright law should not stand in the way of using whatever material you choose in a 3D printer.</p><p>Please <a href="https://dmca.digitalrighttorepair.org/form" target="_blank">click here to weigh in</a>, and please spread the word!</p>
