# Multi-Style Transfer Demo

The long term goal of this project is to set up a page to easily switch between style transfer styles based on works in the [SMK open collection](https://www.smk.dk/en/article/smk-open/)

## Credits
This entire project is based on the [styleTransfer_spell demo from Yining Shi](https://github.com/yining1023/styleTransfer_spell).  Her credits are:

"I used the [TensorFlow implementation of fast style tranfer](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) developed by [Logan Engstrom](https://github.com/lengstrom). And the [fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs](https://github.com/reiinakano/fast-style-transfer-deeplearnjs) by [Reiichiro Nakano](https://github.com/reiinakano) to convert the tensforflow model to a tf.js model that can used in ml5.js"
