I"‹<p>In response to <a href="https://knowingmachines.org/knowing-legal-machines/legal-explainer">a number of copyright lawsuits about AI training datasets</a>, we are starting to see efforts to build â€˜non-infringingâ€™ collections of media for training AI.  While I continue to believe that most AI training is covered by fair use in the US and therefore inherently â€˜non-infringingâ€™, I think these efforts to build â€˜safeâ€™ or â€˜cleanâ€™ or whatever other word one might use data sets are quite interesting.  One reason they are interesting is that they can help illustrate why trying to build such a data set at scale is such a challenge.</p>
