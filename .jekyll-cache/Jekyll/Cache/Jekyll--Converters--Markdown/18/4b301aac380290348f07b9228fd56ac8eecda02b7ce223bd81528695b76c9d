I"º<p><strong>Update 8/2023:</strong> It looks like no one opposed the renewal request (celebrate the absence of opposition comments listed at the bottom of <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/petitions/renewal/">this page</a>). That <em>should</em> mean that the renewal is approved when this process wraps up in a few months. Iâ€™ll post an update when that happens, or if something looks like it might prevent it from happening.</p>
