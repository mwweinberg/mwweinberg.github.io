I"&<p><em>Earlier this year the <a href="https://fas.org">Federation of American Scientists (FAS)</a>, <a href="https://www.cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a>, and the <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/science-and-technology-innovation-program">Wilson Center</a> held an <a href="https://fas.org/accelerator/open-science/">open science policy sprint</a> to source and develop actionable policy ideas aimed at improving scientific transparency, equity, and innovation. Some heroic editing from the FAS team (especially Jordan Dworkin and Grace Wickerson) helped transform “uh, if the government pays for hardware it should be open source” into the actual proposal below.  You can see the original version in situ <a href="https://fas.org/publication/open-source-hardware/">here</a>.</em></p>
