I"S<p>There have been a fantastically large number of maker and open source hardware responses to the Covid-19 virus.  These responses are largely focused on developing stopgap solutions to shortages of medical supplies critical to fighting the outbreak.  While there will be a number of lessons to be learned from studying this movement, I want to flag one in this post: the (unexpectedly?) important role that authorities should play in channeling maker energy in important directions.  Unfortunately, that roleâ€™s importance is becoming clear because authorities have been slow to play it.</p>
