<p>The Engelberg Center on Innovation Law &amp; Policy is pleased to announce the publication of a new whitepaper: <em><a href="/docs/Data_Portability_and_Platform_Competition_-_Is_User_Data_Exported_From_Facebook_Actually_Useful_to_Competitors.pdf">Data Portability and Platform Competition: Is User Data Exported From Facebook Actually Useful to Competitors?</a></em>.   The paper explores how useful data exported from Facebook might be to a potential competitor.  The answer: not very.</p>

<p>The paper, authored by <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg/team/nicholas">Gabriel Nicholas</a> and <a href="https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg/team/weinberg">Michael Weinberg</a>, focuses on a seeming paradox in the current debate around the size and power of platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon.</p>

<p>For those wary of breaking up these large platforms, data portability has emerged as an attractive alternative.  Data portability would allow users to take their data from a large platform to a competitor, potentially making it easier for a competitor to grow and thrive.</p>

<p>The challenge with this hypothesis is that large platforms have allowed users to export their data for almost a decade, yet no major competitor has emerged.  Why is that?</p>

<p>In order to find out, the authors leveraged the Engelberg Centerâ€™s access to New York Cityâ€™s tech community.  They exported data from Facebook and held a series of workshops with engineers, product managers, and executives from a wide range of technology companies.  They asked participants how useful data exported from Facebook would be in building a competitor, and in doing so, learned about some of the limitations of data portability.</p>

<p>The paper documents the weaknesses in data portability as a tool for competition in the context of social media sites, and provides lessons for policymakers interested in integrating data portability into a large set of solutions.</p>
