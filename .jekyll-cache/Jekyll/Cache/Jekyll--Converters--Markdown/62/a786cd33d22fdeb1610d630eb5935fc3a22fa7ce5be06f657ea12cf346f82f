I"é<p>It doesnâ€™t get a lot bigger than this.  On February 25th the Smithsonian <a href="https://www.si.edu/openaccess/">went in big on open access</a>.  With the <a href="https://www.si.edu/openaccess/updates/21st-century-diffusion">push of a button</a>, 2.8 million 2D images and 3D files (3D files!) became available without copyright restriction under a CC0 public domain dedication.  Perhaps just as importantly, those images came with 173 years of metadata created by the Smithsonian staff.  How big a deal is this? The site saw <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/smithsonian-puts-2-8-million-images-public-domain/">4 million image requests</a> within the first six hours of going live.  People want access to their cultural heritage.</p>
