I"Ÿ<p>Moving from NYC to Berlin gave me an excuse to update my old <a href="https://michaelweinberg.org/post/171963532565/pi-powered-mta-subway-alerts">Pi-Powered MTA Subway Alerts</a> project for the BVG.  Now, as then, the goal of the project is to answer the question ‚Äúif I leave my house now, how long will I have to wait for my subway train?‚Äù.  Although, in this case, instead of just answering that question about the subway train, it also answers it for trams.</p>
