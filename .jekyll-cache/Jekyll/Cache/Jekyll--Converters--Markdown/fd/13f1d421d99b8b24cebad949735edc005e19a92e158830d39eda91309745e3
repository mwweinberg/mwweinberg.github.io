I"à<p>Today the ml5.js team unveiled a proposal for a new license to impose ethical use requirements on their open source machine learning library.  The community announcement is <a href="https://medium.com/ml5js/ml5-js-code-of-conduct-4eb8fcae1ef7">here</a>. It is full of useful information about the context, purpose, and goals of the project so I encourage you to check it out. This post is intended to be a bit more focused on the license and license mechanisms themselves.</p>
