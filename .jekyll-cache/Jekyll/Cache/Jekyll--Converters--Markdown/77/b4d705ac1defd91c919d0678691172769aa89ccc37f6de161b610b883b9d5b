I"Ã<p>Today I filed a petition to expand the scope of the current (expiring) rule about unlocking 3D printers.  The full petition is <a href="/docs/1201-expansion-petition-2020.pdf">here</a>.  That follows a petition I filed in July to simply renew the current rule.  That renewal petition is <a href="/docs/1201-renewal-petition-2020.pdf">here</a>.  The petitions are short because the substantive discussion will be reserved for the hearing phase.</p>
