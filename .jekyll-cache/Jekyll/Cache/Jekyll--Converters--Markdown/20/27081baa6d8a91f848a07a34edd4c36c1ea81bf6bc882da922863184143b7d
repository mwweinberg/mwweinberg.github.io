I"Ó<p>Sarah Goehrkeâ€™s recent <a href="https://www.fabbaloo.com/blog/2020/6/8/patenting-pandemic-designs">article</a> on the University of Tennesseeâ€™s new â€˜patent pendingâ€™ 3D printed face shield made me wonder - â€œwhat is going on here?â€  There are a huge number of open source 3D printed face shields out there, and the value of a patent on an â€˜innovationâ€™ in the field would probably be pretty small.  Why bother paying to get a patent in this case?</p>
