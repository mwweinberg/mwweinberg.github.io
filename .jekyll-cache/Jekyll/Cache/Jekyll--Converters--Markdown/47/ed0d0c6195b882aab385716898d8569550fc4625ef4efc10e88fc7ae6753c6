I",<p>I recently found myself reading Mark Lemley’s paper <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4184946">The Benefit of the Bargain</a> while also helping a friend put together the Terms of Service (ToS) for their new startup.  Lemley’s paper essentially argues that modern ToS - documents that are written by services to be one sided and essentially imposed on users as a take-it-or-leave-it offer - should no longer be enforced as contracts because they have lost important fairness elements of what make contracts contracts.</p>
