I"Ä<p>Hi.  Iâ€™m Michael.  I am the Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg">Engelberg Center on Innovation Law and Policy at NYU Law</a>. Iâ€™m also a board member of the <a href="https://www.oshwa.org/">Open Source Hardware Association</a> (where I run the <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/">Open Hardware Certification Program</a>), Co-Director of the <a href="https://www.glamelab.org/">GLAM-E Lab</a>, and a co-creator of <a href="https://www.everybodyisgone.org/">Everybody is Gone</a>.  I split time between Berlin and NYC.</p>

<p>I used to do 3D printing and legal things at <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>.  Before that I tried to make policy, people, and technology work together better in the public interest at <a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:hello@michaelweinberg.org">hello@michaelweinberg.org</a> and find me on bluesky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/michaelweinberg.org">@michaelweinberg.org</a>. I used to be on twitter @MWeinberg2D and mastodon <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mweinberg">@mweinberg</a>.  Email is probably the best way to start a conversation.  I also have a collection of poorly written software-type-things on github as <a href="https://github.com/mwweinberg">MWWeinberg</a>.</p>

<p>If you are curious, you too can have email address on your own domain thanks to <a href="https://konklone.com/post/take-control-of-your-email-address">this fantastic and detailed guide</a> from <a href="https://konklone.com/">Eric Mill</a>.</p>

<p>This site is running on Jekyll and hosted on Github.  It used to run on tumblr.  Maybe someday it will again, although it is looking increasingly unlikely.</p>
