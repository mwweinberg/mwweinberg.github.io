<p>We are currently in the fourth week of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180828075305/https://www.shapeways.com/contests/smk-open-jewelry">contest collaboration</a> with the <a href="http://www.smk.dk/">National Gallery of Denmark</a> (SMK) where we <a href="https://michaelweinberg.org/blog/2017/05/25/shapeways-smk-contest-kickoff/">asked our fantastic jewelry design community</a> to create new pieces inspired by six works from the SMK’s collection.  So far we’ve been blown away by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180828075305/https://www.shapeways.com/contests/smk-open-jewelry">all you have done</a>. We have also been encouraged by all of the positive feedback about the contest from the both the <a href="https://openglam.org/">open museum world</a> and our <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/marketplace/jewelry?li=marketplace">jewelry community</a>.</p>

<p>Among all of the positive feedback, there has been one request that we have received again and again: a bit more time. News of this contest has percolated through a number of new communities, and inspiration can come at its own pace. What we are hearing is that a little more time would allow many of you to create even more entries.</p>

<p>In response to those requests, <strong>we’re extending the contest by one additional week</strong>. Instead of ending on June 16, the contest will now end on <strong>June 23</strong>.</p>

<p>But that’s it! Barring anything truly unexpected, June 23 is going to be the final deadline. That means that if you want a chance to have your work displayed in the <a href="http://www.smk.dk/">National Gallery of Denmark</a>, you need to get cracking. You can see the inspiring works, check out the competition, and read the rules <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180828075305/https://www.shapeways.com/contests/smk-open-jewelry">here</a>.
