I"—<p>Hi.  Iâ€™m Michael.  I am the Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg">Engelberg Center on Innovation Law and Policy at NYU Law</a>. Iâ€™m also the President of the Board of the <a href="https://www.oshwa.org/">Open Source Hardware Association</a> and a co-creator of <a href="https://www.everybodyisgone.org/">Everybody is Gone</a>.</p>

<p>I used to do 3D printing and legal things at <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>.  Before that I tried to make policy, people, and technology work together better in the public interest at <a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:hello@michaelweinberg.org">hello@michaelweinberg.org</a> and find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mweinberg2D">@MWeinberg2D</a>.  Email is much better way to start a conversation than linkedin messenger or whatever.  I also have a collection of poorly written software-type-things on github as <a href="https://github.com/mwweinberg">MWWeinberg</a>.</p>

<p>If you are curious, you too can have email address on your own domain thanks to <a href="https://konklone.com/post/take-control-of-your-email-address">this fantastic and detailed guide</a> from <a href="https://konklone.com/">Eric Mill</a>.</p>

<p>This site is running on Jekyll and hosted on Github.  It used to run on tumblr.  Maybe someday it will again, although it is looking increasingly unlikely.</p>

<p>The header image on the home page is a lithograph of <a href="https://www.si.edu/object/billy-sunday:npg_NPG.74.69">Billy Sunday by George Wesley Bellows</a> from the Smithsonianâ€™s open access collection.</p>
