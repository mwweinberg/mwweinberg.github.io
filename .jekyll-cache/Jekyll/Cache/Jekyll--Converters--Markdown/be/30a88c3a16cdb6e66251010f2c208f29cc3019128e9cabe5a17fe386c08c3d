I"Ä<p><em>Earlier this month the Engelberg Center and Creative Commons released a <a href="/docs/Pioneers-of-Open-Three-Case-Studies.pdf">report</a> on GLAM institutions who were early to adopt open access policies.  This post originally <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/01/12/pioneers-of-open-culture-a-look-back-at-how-open-access-happened-at-three-early-adopters/">ran on the Creative Commons site</a>.  The paper hosted here is the same paper as hosted there.  The only difference is that I simplified the file name from the original ‚ÄúFinal-Pioneers-of-Open-Three-Case-Studies.pdf-correctedByPAVE.pdf‚Äù because, well.</em></p>
