<p>The world is full of <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/2/audio-players-linux">great open source music players</a>, but why stop at using open source just to play music? You can also use open source hardware to make music. All of the instruments described in this article are <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/">certified by the Open Source Hardware Association</a> (OSHWA). That means you are free to build upon them, remix them, or do anything else with them.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-instruments">Open source instruments</h2>

<p>Instruments are always a good place to start when you want to make music. If your instrument choices lean towards the more traditional, the <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/us000010.html">F-F-Fiddle</a> may be the one for you.</p>

<p>The F-F-Fiddle is a full-sized electric violin that you can make with a standard desktop 3D printer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication">fused filament fabrication</a>‚Äîget it?). If you need to see it to believe it, here is a video of the F-F-Fiddle in action:</p>

<p>Mastered the fiddle and interested in something a bit more exotic? How about the <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/ch000001.html">Open Theremin</a>?</p>

<p>Like all theremins, Open Theremin lets you play music without touching the instrument. It is, of course, especially good at making <a href="https://youtu.be/p05ZSHRYXVA?t=771">creepy space sounds</a> for your next sci-fi video or space-themed party.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/uk000005.html">Waft</a> operates similarly by allowing you to control sounds remotely. It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">Lidar</a> to measure the distance of your hand from the sensor. Check it out:</p>

<p>Is the Waft a theremin? I‚Äôm not sure - theremin pedants should weigh in below.</p>

<p>If theremins are too well known for you, <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/es000003.html">SIGNUM</a> may be just what you are looking for. In the words of its developers SIGNUM ‚Äúuncovers the encrypted codes of information and the language of man/machine communication‚Äù by turning invisible wireless communications into audible signals.</p>

<p>Regardless of what instrument you use, you will need to plug it into something. If you want that something to be a Raspberry Pi, try the <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/in000007.html">AudioSense-Pi</a>, which allows you to connect multiple inputs and outputs to your Pi at once.</p>

<p>What about synthesizers? SparkFun‚Äôs <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/us000016.html">SparkPunk Sound Kit</a> is a simple synth that gives you lots of room to play.</p>

<p>Making all this music is great, but you also need to think about how you will listen to it. Fortunately, <a href="https://certification.oshwa.org/us000038.html">EQ-1 headphones</a> are open source and 3D-printable.</p>
