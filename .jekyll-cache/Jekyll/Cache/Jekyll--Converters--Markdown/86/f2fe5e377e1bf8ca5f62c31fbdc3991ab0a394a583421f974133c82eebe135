<p>Today we are excited to announce a special jewelry <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/contests/smk-open-jewelry">contest</a> in partnership with the <a href="http://www.smk.dk/">National Gallery of Denmark</a>. The contest gives the Shapeways design community a chance to have their jewelry displayed and sold in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The National Gallery (known by its Danish initials, SMK) is a leader in the <a href="https://openglam.org/">OpenGLAM</a> movement. OpenGLAM promotes open access to cultural works in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. <a href="http://www.smk.dk/en/about-smk/camp00/">SMK Open</a> makes sure that works in SMKâ€™s collection that are in the public domain (i.e., no longer protected by copyright) can easily be accessed and built upon by the public without restrictions.</p>

<p>The curators at SMK have selected six paintings in the public domain â€” including masterpieces by Cranach, Gijsbrechts, and HammershÃ¸i â€” to serve as the inspiration for this contest. Designers can use these works as jumping-off points to create unique 3D printable jewelry. Since the works are not protected by copyright, designers are free to use whatever parts of the works they wish.</p>

<p>One winner and four runners-up will be displayed at SMK for the month of September 2017. These designs will also be eligible for sale in SMKâ€™s gift shop. A panel of judges, including representatives from SMK and Shapeways, will select the winners.</p>

<p>All you need to do to <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/contests/smk-open-jewelry">enter</a> is to design a new piece of jewelry based on one (or more than one) of the works, upload it to a public Shapeways shop, and <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/marketplace/?tag=SMK">tag it SMK</a>.</p>

<p>But you had better hurry: The contest ends June 16, 2017.</p>
