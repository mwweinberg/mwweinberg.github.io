I"¥<p>Last summer I <a href="https://michaelweinberg.org/blog/2023/07/13/1201-kickoff/">submitted a request</a> that the Copyright Office renew an existing rule that allows users to break DRM that prevents them from using materials of their choice in 3D printers.  As of October 28th, that <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-10-28/pdf/2024-24563.pdf">rule has been renewed</a> for another three years.</p>
