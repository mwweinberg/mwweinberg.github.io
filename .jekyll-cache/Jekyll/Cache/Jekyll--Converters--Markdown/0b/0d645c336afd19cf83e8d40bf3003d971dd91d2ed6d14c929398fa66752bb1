I"@<p>Last month the Metropolitan Museum of Art <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-met-celebrates-150-anniversary-with-limited-edition-items">announced</a> a series of partnerships that brought famous works in the Met’s collections to <a href="https://store.metmuseum.org/150/view-all">limited edition items</a> from a series of brand partners.  This announcement may end up being one of the most important developments for <a href="https://glam3d.org/what_is_open_access.html">museum open access</a> this year (and it’s been a busy year for museum open access).</p>
