I"q<p>Late last week the United States Copyright Office and the Librarian of Congress handed a significant victory to 3D printer users who want to use 3D printing materials of their choice.  The Copyright Office and Librarian published a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-23241.pdf">rule</a> that made it clear that using materials from a someone besides the company that manufactures the 3D printer does not violate copyright law.  This is a win for anyone who wants to experiment with 3D printers, and for the concept of limitations to the scope of copyright law more generally.</p>
