I"<p>Recently I read two blog posts about the intersection of Section 230 and generative AI, specifically LLMs.  While they are both interesting, I think they skip over a potentially limiting constraint on the importance of these questions: the blast radius of any specific piece of AI generated content on a website.  Specifically, it seems plausible that blast radius - or damaging reach of the piece of content - may be fairly limited, which would reduce the likelihood that 230 protections and up being super relevant.*</p>
