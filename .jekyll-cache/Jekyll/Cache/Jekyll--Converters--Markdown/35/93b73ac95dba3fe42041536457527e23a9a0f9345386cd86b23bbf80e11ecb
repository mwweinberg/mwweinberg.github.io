I"<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> (yes, that CERN) announced <a href="https://www.ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-2">version 2.0 of their open hardware licenses</a> (<a href="https://home.cern/news/news/knowledge-sharing/cern-updates-its-open-hardware-licence">announcement</a> and <a href="https://moorcrofts.com/cern-launches-open-hardware-licence-v2/">additional context</a> from them).  Version 2.0 of the license comes in three flavors of permissiveness and marks a major step forward in open source hardware (OSHW) licensing.  It is the result of seven (!) years of work by a team lead by <a href="https://kt.cern/team/myriam-ayass">Myriam Ayass</a>, <a href="https://moorcrofts.com/team/andrew-katz/">Andrew Katz</a>, and <a href="https://phonebook.cern.ch/phonebook/#personDetails/?id=476608">Javier Serrano</a>.  Before getting to what these licenses are doing, this post will provide some background on why open source hardware licensing is so complicated in the first place.</p>
