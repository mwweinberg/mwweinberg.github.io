<p>In the interest of <a href="https://twitter.com/tjl/status/1535290997206294528">celebrating the weirdness of open data</a>, I want to share a quick project that exists because of open data: Abraham Lincolnâ€™s left hand as the shifter knob of a 1995 Mazda truck.</p>

<p>The whole thing was pretty strightforward. In fact, the hardest part was probably finding the right shifter knob adapter for the truck.  All that was required was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Download the Lincoln hand scans from the <a href="https://3d.si.edu/object/3d/abraham-lincoln:d8c642d6-4ebc-11ea-b77f-2e728ce88125">Smithsonian open access site</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use tinkercad to put a hole in the back of the hand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3D print the hand and use epoxy to attach the adapter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
