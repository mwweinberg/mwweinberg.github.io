<p>You should go to the website <a href="http://legalmadness.party/">legalmadness.party</a> right now to check this out.</p>

<p>Here’s the deal. <a href="https://www.sarahfeingold.com/">Sarah Feingold</a> (former Etsy and Vroom GC, current Engelberg Center Fellow) and I were talking about all of the stories that in-house tech lawyers have about the things they have dealt with over the years.</p>

<p>“We should have an open mic night where everyone gets up and shares their stories” we exclaimed together.</p>

<p>“But wait, confidentiality rules would prevent any lawyers from actually telling stories at an open mic night” we also exclaimed together.</p>

<p>“What shall be done?” we wondered aloud, again, together.</p>

<p>What shall be done, indeed.</p>

<p>We collected the stories anonymously. We compiled them into a script. We hired actors to play the role of “tech lawyer at an open mic night” to tell them. We rented out a cool club in the Village. All that is missing is you.</p>

<p>Join the NYC legal tech community for the greatest simulated open mic night is has ever seen. Laugh. Cry. Commiserate. Share a story (anonymously) for next year….</p>
