I"<p>Last week the 3D printing platform <a href="https://www.printables.com/">Printables</a> removed an unknown number of models from their platform.  This action was apparently <a href="https://forum.prusa3d.com/forum/english-forum-general-discussion-announcements-and-releases/model-deleted-by-admin/#post-600420">in response to a letter</a> Printables received from Honda claiming that user models infringed on various rights.  Based on the <a href="https://forum.prusa3d.com/forum/english-forum-general-discussion-announcements-and-releases/model-deleted-by-admin/">discussion of the action in the Printables forum</a>, it appears that at least some of Honda’s claims may have been related to the use of Honda’s trademarks in either model geometry or model descriptions.</p>
