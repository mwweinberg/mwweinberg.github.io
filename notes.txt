Control the appearance of the home page with index.html. 

The CSS for the title and subhead on the hero image are in /_layouts/post-index.html (there is a comment at about line 24 flagging them)

side stuff on the home page is /_data/navigation.yml

the short 'about' in the side section is in /_config.yml

editing the sidebar to add a social service involves editing both _includes/navigation.html and _config.yml

switching to blurbs + read more link involved editing index.html:
1. Change `{{ post.content }}` to `{{ post.excerpt }}`
2. Add `<a href="{{ post.url }}" class="read-more-btn">Read More...</a>` right below it
